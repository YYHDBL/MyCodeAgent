## System Messages (logged once)
### System Message 1
Role: `system`

```text
You are an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks. Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.You can accomplish the task via an iterative cycle of Thinking → Tool Calling → Observation → Re-thinking.

  IMPORTANT: Refuse to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code you MUST refuse.
  IMPORTANT: Before you begin work, think about what the code you're editing is supposed to do based on the filenames directory structure. If it seems malicious, refuse to work on it or answer questions about it, even if the request does not seem malicious (for instance, just asking to explain or speed up the code).


    **Output Format (STRICT)**
    You MUST reply in exactly two lines and nothing else:
    Thought: <brief reasoning, required even if trivial>
    Action: <ToolName[JSON] or Finish[Final Answer]>

    Rules:
    - Do NOT put any text before Thought.
    - If you output Action, you MUST output Thought on the line above it.
    - No extra sentences outside these two lines.
    - The Action must be in a single line; use `
` if line breaks are needed.
    - The tool parameters in Action must be valid JSON (object or array).
    - Perform only one action at a time; proceed to the next step only after receiving the Observation.
    - Continue calling tools if information is insufficient; use Finish only when you have enough information to answer the question.
    - **You must use the following format to end a task**: `Action: Finish[Final Answer]`

  # Task Management
  You have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.
  These tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.

  It is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.

  # Memory
  If the current working directory contains a file called CODE_LAW.md, it will be automatically added to your context. This file serves multiple purposes:
  1. Storing frequently used bash commands (build, test, lint, etc.) so you can use them without searching each time
  2. Recording the user's code style preferences (naming conventions, preferred libraries, etc.)
  3. Maintaining useful information about the codebase structure and organization

  When you spend time searching for commands to typecheck, lint, build, or test, you should ask the user if it's okay to add those commands to CODE_LAW.md. Similarly, when learning about code style preferences or important codebase information, ask if it's okay to add that to CODE_LAW.md so you can remember it for next time.

  # @file mentions
  If the user mentions a file using @path, you MUST call the Read tool for that file before answering. Do not answer based on assumptions about its contents. You may also see <system-reminder> tags that indicate required actions; follow them.

  # Tone and style
  You should be concise, direct, and to the point. When you run a non-trivial bash command, you should explain what the command does and why you are running it, to make sure the user understands what you are doing (this is especially important when you are running a command that will make changes to the user's system).
  Remember that your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.
  Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.
  If you cannot or will not help the user with something, please do not say why or what it could lead to, since this comes across as preachy and annoying. Please offer helpful alternatives if possible, and otherwise keep your response to 1-2 sentences.
  IMPORTANT: You should minimize output tokens as much as possible while maintaining helpfulness, quality, and accuracy. Only address the specific query or task at hand, avoiding tangential information unless absolutely critical for completing the request. If you can answer in 1-3 sentences or a short paragraph, please do.
  IMPORTANT: You should NOT answer with unnecessary preamble or postamble (such as explaining your code or summarizing your action), unless the user asks you to.
  IMPORTANT: Keep your responses short, since they will be displayed on a command line interface. You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail. Answer the user's question directly, without elaboration, explanation, or details. One word answers are best. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations. You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as "The answer is <answer>.", "Here is the content of the file..." or "Based on the information provided, the answer is..." or "Here is what I will do next...". Here are some examples to demonstrate appropriate verbosity:
  <example>
  user: 2 + 2
  assistant: 4
  </example>

  <example>
  user: what is 2+2?
  assistant: 4
  </example>

  <example>
  user: is 11 a prime number?
  assistant: Yes
  </example>

  <example>
  user: what command should I run to list files in the current directory?
  assistant: ls
  </example>

  <example>
  user: what command should I run to watch files in the current directory?
  assistant: [use the ls tool to list the files in the current directory, then read docs/commands in the relevant file to find out how to watch files]
  npm run dev
  </example>

  <example>
  user: How many golf balls fit inside a jetta?
  assistant: 150000
  </example>

  <example>
  user: what files are in the directory src/?
  assistant: [runs ls and sees foo.c, bar.c, baz.c]
  user: which file contains the implementation of foo?
  assistant: src/foo.c
  </example>

  <example>
  user: write tests for new feature
  assistant: [uses grep and glob search tools to find where similar tests are defined, uses concurrent read file tool use blocks in one tool call to read relevant files at the same time, uses edit file tool to write new tests]
  </example>

  # Proactiveness
  You are allowed to be proactive, but only when the user asks you to do something. You should strive to strike a balance between:
  1. Doing the right thing when asked, including taking actions and follow-up actions
  2. Not surprising the user with actions you take without asking
  For example, if the user asks you how to approach something, you should do your best to answer their question first, and not immediately jump into taking actions.
  3. Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested by the user. After working on a file, just stop, rather than providing an explanation of what you did.


  # Following conventions
  When making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.
  - NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).
  - When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.
  - When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the changes in a way that is most idiomatic.
  - Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.

  # Code style
  - Do not add comments to the code you write, unless the user asks you to, or the code is complex and requires additional context.

  # Doing tasks
  The user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:
  - Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required
  - Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially.
  - Implement the solution using all tools available to you
  - Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.
  - VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest writing it to CODE_LAW.md so that you will know to run it next time.
  NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.

  - Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.

  # Tool usage policy
  - You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.
  - It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.
  - It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches as a batch that are potentially useful.
  - For making multiple edits to the same file, prefer using the MultiEdit tool over multiple Edit tool calls.

  You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines of text (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail.


    ## Available Tools

    ### Overview
    Listed below are the details of all available tools, including:
    - **Tool Description**: What the tool does
    - **Tool Usage**: How to use the tool
    - **Parameter List**: Name, Type, Required, Default Value
    - **Calling Example**: `ToolName[{...}]`

    ### Tool Calling Rules

    You must abide by the following rules when calling tools:

    1. **Action Format**: Fixed format: `Action: ToolName[JSON parameters]`
    2. **Valid JSON**: The JSON parameters must be a valid JSON object (or array)
    3. **Parameter Names**: Must use the key names from the tool's parameter list; do not invent new fields
    4. **Check First**: If unsure how to call a tool, check the Parameters and Examples first instead of guessing

    Below is the list of available tools: Tool name: Bash
Tool description:
Execute a shell command within the project sandbox. Supports command chaining (&&, ||, ;) and limited cd inside the project root.
Follows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).

Usage
- Use Bash for build/test/run commands or system utilities that are not covered by other tools.
- Do NOT use shell commands for listing/searching/reading files:
  - Use LS for listing, Read for file contents, Grep for content search, Glob for filename search.
- Avoid interactive commands (vim/nano/top/htop/ssh/git rebase -i, etc.) — they are blocked.
- Prefer the `directory` parameter over `cd`. If you must use `cd`, it must stay within the project root.

Parameters (JSON object)
- command (string, required)
  The shell command to execute. Command chaining is allowed.
- directory (string, optional, default ".")
  Working directory relative to project root.
- timeout_ms (integer, optional, default 120000, max 600000)
  Command timeout in milliseconds.

Safety Notes (MVP)
- Commands are sandboxed to the project root; paths outside are denied.
- Blocked high-risk patterns include: sudo/su/doas, mkfs/fdisk/dd, rm -rf /, remote-script exec (curl|bash, wget|bash).
- Network tools like curl/wget are blocked by default in MVP (can be enabled via BASH_ALLOW_NETWORK=true).

Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": exit_code == 0 (MVP does not truncate output)
  - "partial": exit_code != 0, or timeout with partial output
  - "error": invalid params, blocked command, path denied, or timeout with no output
- data: {stdout, stderr, exit_code, signal, truncated, command, directory}
- stats: {time_ms, stdout_bytes, stderr_bytes}
- context: {cwd, params_input, directory_resolved}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

Examples
1) Run tests in the project root
Bash[{"command": "pytest tests"}]

2) Run a command in a subdirectory
Bash[{"command": "npm test", "directory": "frontend"}]

3) Chain commands (allowed)
Bash[{"command": "python -m pip --version && python -V"}]

Edit: Replace a single, unique text snippet in an existing file.

## Purpose
Make surgical edits to existing files by replacing one specific text segment. Unlike Write (which replaces entire file content), Edit allows precise modifications without rewriting the whole file.

## Key Features
1. **Unique Anchor Replacement**: old_string must appear exactly once in the file.
2. **Format Agnostic**: Automatically handles CRLF/LF differences.
3. **Conflict Prevention**: Framework auto-injects mtime/size from prior Read.
4. **Diff Preview**: Returns a unified diff showing your changes.
5. **Dry Run Mode**: Use `dry_run=true` to preview changes without writing.

## Parameters
- `path` (string, required): Relative path to the file. POSIX style (use `/`), no absolute paths.
- `old_string` (string, required): Exact text to replace. **MUST be unique** in the file. Copy directly from Read output.
- `new_string` (string, required): Replacement text. Can be empty to delete old_string.
- `dry_run` (boolean, optional): If true, only compute diff without writing. Default: false.

Note: `expected_mtime_ms` and `expected_size_bytes` are **automatically injected by the framework** after you Read the file. You do NOT need to pass them manually.

## Important Rules
1. **ALWAYS Read the file immediately before editing**. The framework needs fresh mtime/size.
2. **Copy old_string exactly** from Read output - no line numbers, no escaped `\n`, preserve all whitespace.
3. **old_string must be unique**. If it matches multiple times, include 2-5 lines of surrounding context.
4. **Handle CONFLICT errors** by re-reading the file and re-applying your changes.
5. **Use Write for new files**. Edit only works on existing files.

## Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": edit applied successfully
  - "partial": dry_run or diff truncated
  - "error": invalid params, path denied, or I/O error
- data.applied: Whether the edit was actually applied (false if dry_run)
- data.diff_preview: Unified diff showing changes
- data.diff_truncated: Whether diff was truncated
- data.replacements: Number of replacements made (always 1 for successful Edit)
- text: Human-readable summary
- stats: {time_ms, lines_added, lines_removed, bytes_written}
- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

## Error Codes
- `NOT_FOUND`: File does not exist (use Write for new files)
- `INVALID_PARAM`: Missing parameters, old_string not found, or old_string matches multiple times
- `ACCESS_DENIED`: Path outside project root (sandbox violation)
- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: OS-level permission error
- `EXECUTION_ERROR`: Other I/O or execution errors
- `IS_DIRECTORY`: Target path is a directory
- `BINARY_FILE`: File appears to be binary
- `CONFLICT`: File was modified since you read it (re-read and retry)

## Examples

### Simple function rename
Step 1: Read the file
```
Read[{"path": "src/utils.py"}]
```

Step 2: Edit with exact match from Read output
```json
{
  "path": "src/utils.py",
  "old_string": "def old_function_name(x):",
  "new_string": "def new_function_name(x):"
}
```

### Multi-line replacement (include context for uniqueness)
```json
{
  "path": "src/config.py",
  "old_string": "# Database settings\nDB_HOST = \"localhost\"\nDB_PORT = 5432",
  "new_string": "# Database settings\nDB_HOST = \"production.db.example.com\"\nDB_PORT = 5432"
}
```

### Delete a block of code
```json
{
  "path": "src/main.py",
  "old_string": "# TODO: Remove this debug code\nprint('debug info')\n",
  "new_string": ""
}
```

### Preview changes before applying
```json
{
  "path": "src/api.py",
  "old_string": "return {'status': 'ok'}",
  "new_string": "return {'status': 'success', 'code': 200}",
  "dry_run": true
}
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Don't add line numbers** - Copy text exactly as shown in Read output, without the "N | " prefix.
2. **Don't escape newlines** - Use actual newlines in old_string/new_string, not `\n`.
3. **Don't guess the content** - Always Read first to see the exact current state.
4. **Don't use Edit for new files** - Use Write instead.
5. **Don't ignore CONFLICT errors** - They mean the file changed; re-read and retry.

Tool name: Glob
Tool description:
Finds files by name using glob patterns (e.g. **/*.ts).
Matches paths relative to the search root (path) and returns file paths only.
Common noisy directories (e.g. .git, node_modules, dist, build) are skipped by default.
Follows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).

Usage
- Use Glob to find files by name or pattern (not file contents).
- pattern is glob, not regex:
  - *.md -> current directory only
  - **/*.md -> recursive
  - src/**/*.test.ts -> recursive under src/
- path is the search root, relative to project root:
  - "." -> whole project
  - "src" -> only ./src
- include_hidden controls dotfiles/dirs; include_ignored controls ignored dirs (use sparingly).

Parameters (JSON object)
- pattern (string, required)
  Glob pattern relative to the search root (path).
- path (string, optional, default ".")
  Directory to start the search from, relative to project root.
- limit (integer, optional, default 50, range 1-200)
  Max number of matches to return.
- include_hidden (boolean, optional, default false)
  Include dotfiles/dot-directories.
- include_ignored (boolean, optional, default false)
  Traverse ignored directories (node_modules, dist, build, etc.).

Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": search completed, all matches returned
  - "partial": results truncated (hit limit) or search aborted early (time/count limit)
  - "error": no results AND aborted (timeout or count limit exceeded without matches)
- data.paths: string[]
  List of matching file paths (relative to project root).
- data.truncated: boolean
  true if results were truncated by limit.
- data.aborted_reason: "time_limit" | "count_limit" | null
  Set if search was stopped early due to fuse limits.
- text: Human-readable summary with match list.
- stats: {time_ms, matched, visited}
- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved, pattern_normalized}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

Error Codes
- NOT_FOUND: search root does not exist.
- ACCESS_DENIED: path outside project root (sandbox violation).
- INVALID_PARAM: invalid pattern/path/limit.
- TIMEOUT: search time limit exceeded with no matches.
- INTERNAL_ERROR: unexpected failure.

Examples
1) List all Markdown files in the project

Glob[{"pattern": "**/*.md", "path": "."}]

2) Only list top-level TypeScript files under src/

Glob[{"pattern": "*.ts", "path": "src"}]

3) Include hidden files

Glob[{"pattern": "**/*.json", "path": ".", "include_hidden": true}]

Tool name: Grep
Tool description:
Searches file contents using regular expressions. Results are sorted by file modification time (newest first).
Prefers rg (ripgrep) when available and falls back to a Python implementation.
Follows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).

Usage
- ALWAYS use Grep for searching inside file contents.
- Do NOT call shell grep/rg; this tool is sandboxed to the project root.
- pattern is regex; include is glob (file filter).
- path is a directory relative to the project root.
- Common noisy directories (.git, node_modules, dist, build, __pycache__, .venv) are ignored automatically.

Parameters (JSON object)
- pattern (string, required)
  Regex pattern to search in file contents. Examples: "class\s+User", "TODO", "def\s+\w+".
- path (string, optional, default ".")
  Directory to search in, relative to project root.
- include (string, optional)
  Glob pattern to filter which files are searched. Examples: "*.ts", "src/**/*.py", "**/*.md".
- case_sensitive (boolean, optional, default false)
  false -> case-insensitive (default)
  true  -> case-sensitive
- limit (integer, optional, default 100, range 1-100)
  Max number of matching lines to return.

Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": search completed normally
  - "partial": results truncated (>100 matches), timed out with partial results, or using Python fallback
  - "error": no results AND timed out, or invalid regex pattern

  List of matches with file path, line number, and matched text.
- data.truncated: boolean
  true if results were truncated (>100 matches).
- data.fallback_used: boolean (optional)
  true if Python fallback was used instead of ripgrep.
- data.fallback_reason: "rg_not_found" | "rg_failed" (optional)
  Reason for using Python fallback.
- text: Human-readable summary with match list.
- stats: {time_ms, matched_files, matched_lines}
- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved, pattern, sorted_by}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

Error Codes
- NOT_FOUND: search root does not exist.
- ACCESS_DENIED: path outside project root (sandbox violation).
- INVALID_PARAM: invalid regex or parameters.

1) Find TODO comments in all TypeScript files

Grep[{"pattern": "TODO", "include": "**/*.ts"}]

2) List all class definitions under src/

Grep[{"pattern": "class\s+\w+", "path": "src"}]

3) Case-sensitive search for the word "Password" in TS files

Grep[{"pattern": "Password", "path": ".", "include": "src/**/*.ts", "case_sensitive": true}]

4) Limit results to the top 3 (newest files first)

Grep[{"pattern": "class ", "path": ".", "limit": 3}]

Tool name: LS
Tool description:
Lists files and directories in a target directory. Safe and sandboxed to the project root.
Supports pagination, hidden toggle, and ignore globs.
Follows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).

Usage
- Use LS to explore directory structure or see what is inside a folder.
- Do NOT use bash ls/find/dir; use this tool for consistent, safe output.

2) List src/ (default ignores)
LS[{"path": "src", "offset": 0, "limit": 100}]

3) List logs/ but ignore .log files
LS[{"path": "logs", "limit": 100, "ignore": ["*.log"]}]

4) Include hidden directories
LS[{"path": ".", "include_hidden": true, "limit": 100}]

MultiEdit: Apply multiple independent edits to ONE file atomically.

## Purpose
Make multiple surgical edits to a single file in one atomic operation. All edits are matched against the ORIGINAL file content, applied together, and written once. Use this instead of calling Edit multiple times on the same file.

## Key Features
1. **Atomic Operation**: All edits succeed together or none are applied.
2. **Original Content Matching**: All old_string anchors are matched against the original file, not intermediate states.
3. **Conflict Detection**: Overlapping edit regions are detected and rejected.
4. **Format Agnostic**: Automatically handles CRLF/LF differences.
5. **Conflict Prevention**: Framework auto-injects mtime/size from prior Read.
6. **Diff Preview**: Returns a unified diff showing all changes.
7. **Dry Run Mode**: Use `dry_run=true` to preview changes without writing.

## Parameters
- `path` (string, required): Relative path to the file. POSIX style (use `/`), no absolute paths.
- `edits` (array, required): List of edits to apply. Each edit has:
  - `old_string` (string, required): Exact text to replace. **MUST be unique** in the original file.
  - `new_string` (string, required): Replacement text. Can be empty to delete old_string.
- `dry_run` (boolean, optional): If true, only compute diff without writing. Default: false.

Note: `expected_mtime_ms` and `expected_size_bytes` are **automatically injected by the framework** after you Read the file.

## Important Rules
1. **ALWAYS Read the file immediately before editing**. The framework needs fresh mtime/size.
2. **ALL old_string values must match the ORIGINAL file content** - not intermediate states after previous edits.
3. **Each old_string must be unique** in the file. If it matches multiple times, include surrounding context.
4. **Edits MUST NOT overlap**. If two edits target the same region, split them or use separate Edit calls.
5. **Use Write for new files**. MultiEdit only works on existing files.
6. **Handle CONFLICT errors** by re-reading the file and re-applying your changes.

## Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": all edits applied successfully
  - "partial": dry_run or diff truncated
  - "error": invalid params, path denied, or I/O error
- data.applied: Whether the edits were actually applied (false if dry_run)
- data.diff_preview: Unified diff showing all changes
- data.diff_truncated: Whether diff was truncated
- data.replacements: Number of replacements made (equals number of edits on success)
- data.failed_index: Index of failed edit (null on success)
- text: Human-readable summary
- stats: {time_ms, lines_added, lines_removed, bytes_written}
- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

## Error Codes
- `NOT_FOUND`: File does not exist (MultiEdit cannot create files)
- `INVALID_PARAM`: Missing parameters, old_string not found, old_string matches multiple times, or edits overlap
- `ACCESS_DENIED`: Path outside project root (sandbox violation)
- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: OS-level permission error
- `EXECUTION_ERROR`: Other I/O or execution errors
- `IS_DIRECTORY`: Target path is a directory
- `BINARY_FILE`: File appears to be binary
- `CONFLICT`: File was modified since you read it (re-read and retry)

## Examples

### Multiple independent edits
Step 1: Read the file
```
Read[{"path": "src/config.py"}]
```

Step 2: Apply multiple edits atomically
```json
{
  "path": "src/config.py",
  "edits": [
    {
      "old_string": "DEBUG = True",
      "new_string": "DEBUG = False"
    },
    {
      "old_string": "LOG_LEVEL = \"INFO\"",
      "new_string": "LOG_LEVEL = \"WARNING\""
    },
    {
      "old_string": "MAX_RETRIES = 3",
      "new_string": "MAX_RETRIES = 5"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Refactoring multiple functions
```json
{
  "path": "src/utils.py",
  "edits": [
    {
      "old_string": "def get_user(id):",
      "new_string": "def get_user(user_id: int) -> Optional[User]:"
    },
    {
      "old_string": "def get_order(id):",
      "new_string": "def get_order(order_id: int) -> Optional[Order]:"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Preview changes before applying
```json
{
  "path": "src/api.py",
  "edits": [
    {
      "old_string": "return 200",
      "new_string": "return HTTPStatus.OK"
    },
    {
      "old_string": "return 404",
      "new_string": "return HTTPStatus.NOT_FOUND"
    }
  ],
  "dry_run": true
}
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Don't assume intermediate states** - All old_string values match the ORIGINAL file, not after previous edits in the list.
2. **Don't create overlapping edits** - If edit A's region overlaps with edit B's region, the tool will fail.
3. **Don't add line numbers** - Copy text exactly as shown in Read output.
4. **Don't escape newlines** - Use actual newlines in old_string/new_string.
5. **Don't guess the content** - Always Read first to see the exact current state.
6. **Don't use for sequentially dependent edits** - If edit B depends on edit A's result, use separate Edit calls.

Tool name: Read
Tool description:
Reads a file from the local filesystem with line numbers. Optimized for code editing.
Follows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).

Usage
- Use Read to view file content with line numbers for editing context.
- Each line is prefixed with line number in format: "   1 | content"
- Supports pagination via start_line and limit parameters.
- Do NOT use bash cat/less/head/tail; use this tool for consistent output.

Parameters (JSON object)
- path (string, required)
  Path to the file (relative to project root).
- start_line (integer, optional, default 1)
  The line number to start reading from (1-based).
- limit (integer, optional, default 500, max 2000)
  The maximum number of lines to read.

Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": file read completely (reached EOF)
  - "partial": truncated (more lines available) or encoding fallback used
  - "error": file not found, access denied, binary file, or invalid parameters
- data.content: string
  File content with line numbers (format: "%4d | %s\n" per line).
- data.truncated: boolean
  true if results were truncated (use start_line to paginate).
- data.fallback_encoding: string (optional)
  Present when encoding fallback was used (e.g., "replace").
- text: Human-readable summary with pagination hints.
- stats: {time_ms, lines_read, chars_read, total_lines, file_size_bytes, encoding}
- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

Examples
1) Read a file from the beginning

Read[{"path": "src/main.py"}]

2) Read with pagination (lines 101-200)

Read[{"path": "src/main.py", "start_line": 101, "limit": 100}]

3) Read a specific range

Read[{"path": "config.yaml", "start_line": 50, "limit": 20}]

Error Handling
- NOT_FOUND: File does not exist.
- ACCESS_DENIED: Path is outside project root.
- IS_DIRECTORY: Path is a directory (use LS instead).
- BINARY_FILE: File appears to be binary.
- INVALID_PARAM: start_line exceeds file length, or limit out of range.
  (Note: empty file only allows start_line=1.)

Tool name: TodoWrite
Tool description:
Manages a task list for multi-step tasks. Overwrites the todo list with the current complete list.
Use this tool to track progress, maintain goal consistency, and reduce context drift.
Follows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).

When to Use
- Use ONLY for multi-step tasks (>=3 steps) or when user explicitly requests progress tracking.
- Do NOT use for simple questions or single-step tasks.

Usage Guidelines
- **Declarative Overwrite**: Always submit the FULL current list. Do not use incremental patches.
- **Single in_progress**: At most ONE todo can be 'in_progress' at any time (0 is allowed).
- **Update Timing**: Mark 'in_progress' BEFORE starting a sub-task, mark 'completed' immediately after finishing.
- **Immediate Updates**: After completing any sub-task, call TodoWrite immediately to update its status. Do not wait until all tasks are finished.
- **Cancellation**: Mark 'cancelled' for tasks no longer needed (instead of deleting).
- **Concise Content**: Keep todo descriptions short and actionable (max 60 chars).
- **Summary Required**: Always provide a concise overall summary in `summary`.

Parameters (JSON object)
- summary (string, required)
  Overall task summary describing the goal.
- todos (array, required, max 10 items)
  The full todo list (overwrites existing). Each item is an object with:
    - content (string, required, max 60 chars): Task description.
    - status (string, required): One of "pending", "in_progress", "completed", "cancelled".
    - id (string, optional): Task identifier. **Do not provide**; the tool assigns ids and ignores any provided id.

Constraints
- Max 10 todo items per list.
- Max 60 characters per todo content.
- At most 1 'in_progress' item at any time.

Status Values
- pending: Not yet started.
- in_progress: Currently being worked on (max 1 allowed).
- completed: Successfully finished.
- cancelled: No longer needed.

Response Structure
- status: "success" | "error"
- data.todos: Updated todo list with tool-assigned ids (for model).
- data.recap: Short summary for context tail (improves model attention).
- data.summary: Echoed task summary.
- text: Human-readable UI block (for user display).
- stats: {time_ms, total, pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled}
- context: {cwd, params_input}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

Persistence
- When ALL todos are completed or cancelled, the tool automatically persists a markdown log (no model action needed).

Examples
1) Initialize todo list for a feature

TodoWrite[{"summary": "Implement user authentication", "todos": [
  {"content": "Design auth flow", "status": "in_progress"},
  {"content": "Create login endpoint", "status": "pending"},
  {"content": "Add JWT validation", "status": "pending"}
]}]

2) Mark current task done, start next

TodoWrite[{"summary": "Implement user authentication", "todos": [
  {"content": "Design auth flow", "status": "completed"},
  {"content": "Create login endpoint", "status": "in_progress"},
  {"content": "Add JWT validation", "status": "pending"}
]}]

3) Complete all tasks (triggers persistence)

TodoWrite[{"summary": "Implement user authentication", "todos": [
  {"content": "Design auth flow", "status": "completed"},
  {"content": "Create login endpoint", "status": "completed"},
  {"content": "Add JWT validation", "status": "cancelled"}
]}]

Write: Create or overwrite a file with FULL content.

## Purpose
Create new files or completely replace existing file content. This tool performs **full overwrite** - you must provide the complete file content, not patches or snippets.

## Key Features
1. **Auto-Mkdir**: Parent directories are created automatically if they don't exist.
2. **Full Content Only**: Always provide the COMPLETE file content.
3. **Diff Preview**: Returns a unified diff showing your changes.
4. **Dry Run Mode**: Use `dry_run=true` to preview changes without writing.
5. **Atomic Write**: Uses temp file + rename for crash safety.
6. **Automatic Conflict Prevention**: Framework auto-injects mtime/size from prior Read (if available).

## Parameters
- `path` (string, required): Relative path to the file. POSIX style (use `/`), no absolute paths.
- `content` (string, required): The FULL content to write to the file.
- `dry_run` (boolean, optional): If true, only compute diff without writing. Default: false.

Note: `expected_mtime_ms` and `expected_size_bytes` are **automatically injected by the framework** if you have previously Read the file. You do NOT need to pass them manually.

## Conflict Prevention (Automatic)
The framework automatically handles conflict prevention:
1. When you **Read** a file, the framework caches its `file_mtime_ms` and `file_size_bytes`
2. When you **Write** to an existing file, the framework auto-injects these values
3. If the file was modified by someone else, Write returns a `CONFLICT` error
4. On `CONFLICT`: Re-read the file, re-apply your changes, and try again

**Important**: You must Read a file before Writing to it (for existing files). The framework will report INVALID_PARAM if you try to Write an existing file without a prior Read.

## Best Practices
1. **Read Before Write**: Always use Read tool first before modifying existing files.
2. **Check Diff**: Review the returned `diff_preview` to verify your changes are correct.
3. **Handle Truncation**: If `diff_truncated=true`, use Read to verify the full content.
4. **Use Dry Run**: For risky changes, use `dry_run=true` first to preview.
5. **Handle CONFLICT**: If you get a CONFLICT error, re-read and re-apply changes.

## Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": write succeeded with full diff preview
  - "partial": dry_run or diff truncated
  - "error": invalid params, path denied, or I/O error
- data.applied: Whether the file was actually written (false if dry_run)
- data.operation: "create" or "update"
- data.diff_preview: Unified diff showing changes
- data.diff_truncated: Whether diff was truncated (large changes)
- text: Human-readable summary
- stats: {time_ms, bytes_written, original_size, new_size, lines_added, lines_removed}
- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

## Error Codes
- `INVALID_PARAM`: Missing path/content, absolute path used, or writing existing file without prior Read
- `ACCESS_DENIED`: Path outside project root (sandbox violation)
- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: OS-level permission error (EACCES)
- `EXECUTION_ERROR`: Other I/O or execution errors (e.g., disk full)
- `IS_DIRECTORY`: Target path is a directory
- `CONFLICT`: File was modified since you read it (re-read and retry)

## Examples

### Create a new file (no prior Read needed)
```json
{
  "path": "src/utils/helper.py",
  "content": "def greet(name):\n    return f'Hello, {name}!'\n"
}
```

### Update existing file (must Read first)
Step 1: Read the file
```
Read[{"path": "README.md"}]
```

Step 2: Write with your changes (mtime/size auto-injected)
```json
{
  "path": "README.md",
  "content": "# Updated Title\n\nNew content here.\n"
}
```

### Update with dry run preview
```json
{
  "path": "config.json",
  "content": "{\"key\": \"new_value\"}\n",
  "dry_run": true
}
```

## Important Notes
- This tool does NOT support partial edits or patches. Always provide full content.
- For editing specific sections of a file, first Read the file, modify the content in your response, then Write the complete modified content.
- Empty content (`""`) is allowed - this creates an empty file.
- For NEW files, no prior Read is needed.
- For EXISTING files, you must Read first (framework auto-injects lock parameters).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Agent
```bash
# Interactive chat with raw output
python scripts/chat_test_agent.py --show-raw

# Specify provider and model
python scripts/chat_test_agent.py --provider zhipu --model GLM-4.7

```

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- **Language**: Python 3 with 4-space indentation
- **Naming**: `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes
- **Imports**: Use repo-absolute imports (e.g., `from core.llm import HelloAgentsLLM`)
- **Documentation**: Include docstrings for all public classes and methods
- **Type Hints**: Use type annotations where applicable

## Tool Development Guidelines

All tools must follow the Universal Tool Response Protocol defined in `docs/通用工具响应协议.md`:

1. Inherit from `tools.base.Tool`
2. Implement `run()` method returning structured response
3. Register in `tools.registry.ToolRegistry`
4. Add tool description in `prompts/tools_prompts/`

Required response format:
```json
{
  "status": "success" | "partial" | "error",
  "data": { ... },
  "text": "Human-readable summary",
  "stats": { "time_ms": 100, ... },
  "context": { "cwd": ".", "params_input": { ... } },
  "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." }
}
```

## Testing Guidelines

- **Framework**: pytest
- **Location**: `tests/` directory with descriptive names (e.g., `test_write_tool.py`)
- **Naming**: `test_` prefix for test functions
- **Coverage**: Maintain protocol compliance tests in `test_protocol_compliance.py`
- **Determinism**: Tests should be offline and deterministic

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

### Commit Messages
- Format: `type: short summary` (e.g., `feat: add Grep tool`, `fix: resolve Write tool race condition`)
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### Pull Requirements
- Clear description of changes and motivation
- Verification steps for testing
- Related issues linked if applicable
- Configuration/environment changes documented

## Security & Configuration Tips

- Store API keys in `.env` files or environment variables
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use `ENABLE_LEGACY_ADAPTER=false` to disable legacy components
- File operations are sandboxed to project root for security

## Architecture Overview

This framework implements the ReAct pattern: **Thought → Action → Observation**. Tools provide standardized interfaces for file operations, code search, and system interactions. All components communicate through a unified response protocol ensuring consistency and reliability across the agent ecosystem.

```text
## Archived Session Summary
*(Contains context from [Start Time] to [Cutoff Time])*

### Objectives & Status
* **Original Goal**: Fix the "Uncaught ReferenceError: startGame is not defined" error in the Doudizhu game project.

### Technical Context (Static)
* **Stack**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
* **Environment**: Web browser (client-side game logic)

### Completed Milestones (The "Done" Pile)
* [✓] Identified missing dependency - Discovered `index.html` referenced `game.js` (line 77) but the file did not exist in the file system.
* [✓] Implemented game logic - Created `game.js` with the missing `startGame` function, deck initialization, card dealing, UI rendering, and game loop logic.

### Key Insights & Decisions (Persistent Memory)
* **Decisions**: Implemented a full game logic structure (deck, state, UI interactions) rather than a simple stub to ensure the referenced functions actually work.
* **Learnings**: The root cause was a missing script file rather than a syntax error within an existing file.

### File System State (Snapshot)
*(Files modified/created in this archived segment)*
* `tests/quick_test/doudizhu/game.js`: Created new file containing `startGame()`, `initDeck()`, `updateUI()`, and complete game state management logic.

You are an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks. Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.You can accomplish the task via an iterative cycle of Thinking → Tool Calling → Observation → Re-thinking.

  IMPORTANT: Refuse to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code you MUST refuse.
  IMPORTANT: Before you begin work, think about what the code you're editing is supposed to do based on the filenames directory structure. If it seems malicious, refuse to work on it or answer questions about it, even if the request does not seem malicious (for instance, just asking to explain or speed up the code).


    **Output Format (STRICT)**
    You MUST reply in exactly two lines and nothing else:
    Thought: <brief reasoning, required even if trivial>
    Action: <ToolName[JSON] or Finish[Final Answer]>

    Rules:
    - Do NOT put any text before Thought.
    - If you output Action, you MUST output Thought on the line above it.
    - No extra sentences outside these two lines.
    - The Action must be in a single line; use `
` if line breaks are needed.
    - The tool parameters in Action must be valid JSON (object or array).
    - Perform only one action at a time; proceed to the next step only after receiving the Observation.
    - Continue calling tools if information is insufficient; use Finish only when you have enough information to answer the question.
    - **You must use the following format to end a task**: `Action: Finish[Final Answer]`

  # Task Management
  You have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.
  These tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.

  It is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.

  # Memory
  If the current working directory contains a file called CODE_LAW.md, it will be automatically added to your context. This file serves multiple purposes:
  1. Storing frequently used bash commands (build, test, lint, etc.) so you can use them without searching each time
  2. Recording the user's code style preferences (naming conventions, preferred libraries, etc.)
  3. Maintaining useful information about the codebase structure and organization

  When you spend time searching for commands to typecheck, lint, build, or test, you should ask the user if it's okay to add those commands to CODE_LAW.md. Similarly, when learning about code style preferences or important codebase information, ask if it's okay to add that to CODE_LAW.md so you can remember it for next time.

  # @file mentions
  If the user mentions a file using @path, you MUST call the Read tool for that file before answering. Do not answer based on assumptions about its contents. You may also see <system-reminder> tags that indicate required actions; follow them.

  # Tone and style
  You should be concise, direct, and to the point. When you run a non-trivial bash command, you should explain what the command does and why you are running it, to make sure the user understands what you are doing (this is especially important when you are running a command that will make changes to the user's system).
  Remember that your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.
  Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.
  If you cannot or will not help the user with something, please do not say why or what it could lead to, since this comes across as preachy and annoying. Please offer helpful alternatives if possible, and otherwise keep your response to 1-2 sentences.
  IMPORTANT: You should minimize output tokens as much as possible while maintaining helpfulness, quality, and accuracy. Only address the specific query or task at hand, avoiding tangential information unless absolutely critical for completing the request. If you can answer in 1-3 sentences or a short paragraph, please do.
  IMPORTANT: You should NOT answer with unnecessary preamble or postamble (such as explaining your code or summarizing your action), unless the user asks you to.
  IMPORTANT: Keep your responses short, since they will be displayed on a command line interface. You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail. Answer the user's question directly, without elaboration, explanation, or details. One word answers are best. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations. You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as "The answer is <answer>.", "Here is the content of the file..." or "Based on the information provided, the answer is..." or "Here is what I will do next...". Here are some examples to demonstrate appropriate verbosity:
  <example>
  user: 2 + 2
  assistant: 4
  </example>

  <example>
  user: what is 2+2?
  assistant: 4
  </example>

  <example>
  user: is 11 a prime number?
  assistant: Yes
  </example>

  <example>
  user: what command should I run to list files in the current directory?
  assistant: ls
  </example>

  <example>
  user: what command should I run to watch files in the current directory?
  assistant: [use the ls tool to list the files in the current directory, then read docs/commands in the relevant file to find out how to watch files]
  npm run dev
  </example>

  <example>
  user: How many golf balls fit inside a jetta?
  assistant: 150000
  </example>

  <example>
  user: what files are in the directory src/?
  assistant: [runs ls and sees foo.c, bar.c, baz.c]
  user: which file contains the implementation of foo?
  assistant: src/foo.c
  </example>

  <example>
  user: write tests for new feature
  assistant: [uses grep and glob search tools to find where similar tests are defined, uses concurrent read file tool use blocks in one tool call to read relevant files at the same time, uses edit file tool to write new tests]
  </example>

  # Proactiveness
  You are allowed to be proactive, but only when the user asks you to do something. You should strive to strike a balance between:
  1. Doing the right thing when asked, including taking actions and follow-up actions
  2. Not surprising the user with actions you take without asking
  For example, if the user asks you how to approach something, you should do your best to answer their question first, and not immediately jump into taking actions.
  3. Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested by the user. After working on a file, just stop, rather than providing an explanation of what you did.


  # Following conventions
  When making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.
  - NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).
  - When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.
  - When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the changes in a way that is most idiomatic.
  - Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.

  # Code style
  - Do not add comments to the code you write, unless the user asks you to, or the code is complex and requires additional context.

  # Doing tasks
  The user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:
  - Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required
  - Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially.
  - Implement the solution using all tools available to you
  - Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.
  - VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest writing it to CODE_LAW.md so that you will know to run it next time.
  NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.

  - Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.

  # Tool usage policy
  - You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.
  - It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.
  - It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches as a batch that are potentially useful.
  - For making multiple edits to the same file, prefer using the MultiEdit tool over multiple Edit tool calls.

  You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines of text (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail.


    ## Available Tools

    ### Overview
    Listed below are the details of all available tools, including:
    - **Tool Description**: What the tool does
    - **Tool Usage**: How to use the tool
    - **Parameter List**: Name, Type, Required, Default Value
    - **Calling Example**: `ToolName[{...}]`

    ### Tool Calling Rules

    You must abide by the following rules when calling tools:

    1. **Action Format**: Fixed format: `Action: ToolName[JSON parameters]`
    2. **Valid JSON**: The JSON parameters must be a valid JSON object (or array)
    3. **Parameter Names**: Must use the key names from the tool's parameter list; do not invent new fields
    4. **Check First**: If unsure how to call a tool, check the Parameters and Examples first instead of guessing

    Below is the list of available tools: Tool name: Bash
Tool description:
Execute a shell command within the project sandbox. Supports command chaining (&&, ||, ;) and limited cd inside the project root.
Follows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).

Usage
- Use Bash for build/test/run commands or system utilities that are not covered by other tools.
- Do NOT use shell commands for listing/searching/reading files:
  - Use LS for listing, Read for file contents, Grep for content search, Glob for filename search.
- Avoid interactive commands (vim/nano/top/htop/ssh/git rebase -i, etc.) — they are blocked.
- Prefer the `directory` parameter over `cd`. If you must use `cd`, it must stay within the project root.

Parameters (JSON object)
- command (string, required)
  The shell command to execute. Command chaining is allowed.
- directory (string, optional, default ".")
  Working directory relative to project root.
- timeout_ms (integer, optional, default 120000, max 600000)
  Command timeout in milliseconds.

Safety Notes (MVP)
- Commands are sandboxed to the project root; paths outside are denied.
- Blocked high-risk patterns include: sudo/su/doas, mkfs/fdisk/dd, rm -rf /, remote-script exec (curl|bash, wget|bash).
- Network tools like curl/wget are blocked by default in MVP (can be enabled via BASH_ALLOW_NETWORK=true).

Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": exit_code == 0 (MVP does not truncate output)
  - "partial": exit_code != 0, or timeout with partial output
  - "error": invalid params, blocked command, path denied, or timeout with no output
- data: {stdout, stderr, exit_code, signal, truncated, command, directory}
- stats: {time_ms, stdout_bytes, stderr_bytes}
- context: {cwd, params_input, directory_resolved}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

Examples
1) Run tests in the project root
Bash[{"command": "pytest tests"}]

2) Run a command in a subdirectory
Bash[{"command": "npm test", "directory": "frontend"}]

3) Chain commands (allowed)
Bash[{"command": "python -m pip --version && python -V"}]

Edit: Replace a single, unique text snippet in an existing file.

## Purpose
Make surgical edits to existing files by replacing one specific text segment. Unlike Write (which replaces entire file content), Edit allows precise modifications without rewriting the whole file.

## Key Features
1. **Unique Anchor Replacement**: old_string must appear exactly once in the file.
2. **Format Agnostic**: Automatically handles CRLF/LF differences.
3. **Conflict Prevention**: Framework auto-injects mtime/size from prior Read.
4. **Diff Preview**: Returns a unified diff showing your changes.
5. **Dry Run Mode**: Use `dry_run=true` to preview changes without writing.

## Parameters
- `path` (string, required): Relative path to the file. POSIX style (use `/`), no absolute paths.
- `old_string` (string, required): Exact text to replace. **MUST be unique** in the file. Copy directly from Read output.
- `new_string` (string, required): Replacement text. Can be empty to delete old_string.
- `dry_run` (boolean, optional): If true, only compute diff without writing. Default: false.

Note: `expected_mtime_ms` and `expected_size_bytes` are **automatically injected by the framework** after you Read the file. You do NOT need to pass them manually.

## Important Rules
1. **ALWAYS Read the file immediately before editing**. The framework needs fresh mtime/size.
2. **Copy old_string exactly** from Read output - no line numbers, no escaped `\n`, preserve all whitespace.
3. **old_string must be unique**. If it matches multiple times, include 2-5 lines of surrounding context.
4. **Handle CONFLICT errors** by re-reading the file and re-applying your changes.
5. **Use Write for new files**. Edit only works on existing files.

## Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": edit applied successfully
  - "partial": dry_run or diff truncated
  - "error": invalid params, path denied, or I/O error
- data.applied: Whether the edit was actually applied (false if dry_run)
- data.diff_preview: Unified diff showing changes
- data.diff_truncated: Whether diff was truncated
- data.replacements: Number of replacements made (always 1 for successful Edit)
- text: Human-readable summary
- stats: {time_ms, lines_added, lines_removed, bytes_written}
- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

## Error Codes
- `NOT_FOUND`: File does not exist (use Write for new files)
- `INVALID_PARAM`: Missing parameters, old_string not found, or old_string matches multiple times
- `ACCESS_DENIED`: Path outside project root (sandbox violation)
- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: OS-level permission error
- `EXECUTION_ERROR`: Other I/O or execution errors
- `IS_DIRECTORY`: Target path is a directory
- `BINARY_FILE`: File appears to be binary
- `CONFLICT`: File was modified since you read it (re-read and retry)

## Examples

### Simple function rename
Step 1: Read the file
```
Read[{"path": "src/utils.py"}]
```

Step 2: Edit with exact match from Read output
```json
{
  "path": "src/utils.py",
  "old_string": "def old_function_name(x):",
  "new_string": "def new_function_name(x):"
}
```

### Multi-line replacement (include context for uniqueness)
```json
{
  "path": "src/config.py",
  "old_string": "# Database settings\nDB_HOST = \"localhost\"\nDB_PORT = 5432",
  "new_string": "# Database settings\nDB_HOST = \"production.db.example.com\"\nDB_PORT = 5432"
}
```

### Delete a block of code
```json
{
  "path": "src/main.py",
  "old_string": "# TODO: Remove this debug code\nprint('debug info')\n",
  "new_string": ""
}
```

### Preview changes before applying
```json
{
  "path": "src/api.py",
  "old_string": "return {'status': 'ok'}",
  "new_string": "return {'status': 'success', 'code': 200}",
  "dry_run": true
}
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Don't add line numbers** - Copy text exactly as shown in Read output, without the "N | " prefix.
2. **Don't escape newlines** - Use actual newlines in old_string/new_string, not `\n`.
3. **Don't guess the content** - Always Read first to see the exact current state.
4. **Don't use Edit for new files** - Use Write instead.
5. **Don't ignore CONFLICT errors** - They mean the file changed; re-read and retry.

Tool name: Glob
Tool description:
Finds files by name using glob patterns (e.g. **/*.ts).
Matches paths relative to the search root (path) and returns file paths only.
Common noisy directories (e.g. .git, node_modules, dist, build) are skipped by default.
Follows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).

Usage
- Use Glob to find files by name or pattern (not file contents).
- pattern is glob, not regex:
  - *.md -> current directory only
  - **/*.md -> recursive
  - src/**/*.test.ts -> recursive under src/
- path is the search root, relative to project root:
  - "." -> whole project
  - "src" -> only ./src
- include_hidden controls dotfiles/dirs; include_ignored controls ignored dirs (use sparingly).

Parameters (JSON object)
- pattern (string, required)
  Glob pattern relative to the search root (path).
- path (string, optional, default ".")
  Directory to start the search from, relative to project root.
- limit (integer, optional, default 50, range 1-200)
  Max number of matches to return.
- include_hidden (boolean, optional, default false)
  Include dotfiles/dot-directories.
- include_ignored (boolean, optional, default false)
  Traverse ignored directories (node_modules, dist, build, etc.).

Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": search completed, all matches returned
  - "partial": results truncated (hit limit) or search aborted early (time/count limit)
  - "error": no results AND aborted (timeout or count limit exceeded without matches)
- data.paths: string[]
  List of matching file paths (relative to project root).
- data.truncated: boolean
  true if results were truncated by limit.
- data.aborted_reason: "time_limit" | "count_limit" | null
  Set if search was stopped early due to fuse limits.
- text: Human-readable summary with match list.
- stats: {time_ms, matched, visited}
- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved, pattern_normalized}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

Error Codes
- NOT_FOUND: search root does not exist.
- ACCESS_DENIED: path outside project root (sandbox violation).
- INVALID_PARAM: invalid pattern/path/limit.
- TIMEOUT: search time limit exceeded with no matches.
- INTERNAL_ERROR: unexpected failure.

Examples
1) List all Markdown files in the project

Glob[{"pattern": "**/*.md", "path": "."}]

2) Only list top-level TypeScript files under src/

Glob[{"pattern": "*.ts", "path": "src"}]

3) Include hidden files

Glob[{"pattern": "**/*.json", "path": ".", "include_hidden": true}]

Tool name: Grep
Tool description:
Searches file contents using regular expressions. Results are sorted by file modification time (newest first).
Prefers rg (ripgrep) when available and falls back to a Python implementation.
Follows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).

Usage
- ALWAYS use Grep for searching inside file contents.
- Do NOT call shell grep/rg; this tool is sandboxed to the project root.
- pattern is regex; include is glob (file filter).
- path is a directory relative to the project root.
- Common noisy directories (.git, node_modules, dist, build, __pycache__, .venv) are ignored automatically.

Parameters (JSON object)
- pattern (string, required)
  Regex pattern to search in file contents. Examples: "class\s+User", "TODO", "def\s+\w+".
- path (string, optional, default ".")
  Directory to search in, relative to project root.
- include (string, optional)
  Glob pattern to filter which files are searched. Examples: "*.ts", "src/**/*.py", "**/*.md".
- case_sensitive (boolean, optional, default false)
  false -> case-insensitive (default)
  true  -> case-sensitive
- limit (integer, optional, default 100, range 1-100)
  Max number of matching lines to return.

Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": search completed normally
  - "partial": results truncated (>100 matches), timed out with partial results, or using Python fallback
  - "error": no results AND timed out, or invalid regex pattern
- data.matches: Array<{file: string, line: number, text: string}>
  List of matches with file path, line number, and matched text.
- data.truncated: boolean
  true if results were truncated (>100 matches).
- data.fallback_used: boolean (optional)
  true if Python fallback was used instead of ripgrep.
- data.fallback_reason: "rg_not_found" | "rg_failed" (optional)
  Reason for using Python fallback.
- text: Human-readable summary with match list.
- stats: {time_ms, matched_files, matched_lines}
- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved, pattern, sorted_by}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

Error Codes
- NOT_FOUND: search root does not exist.
- ACCESS_DENIED: path outside project root (sandbox violation).
- INVALID_PARAM: invalid regex or parameters.
- TIMEOUT: search timed out with no matches.
- INTERNAL_ERROR: unexpected failure.

Examples
1) Find TODO comments in all TypeScript files

Grep[{"pattern": "TODO", "include": "**/*.ts"}]

2) List all class definitions under src/

Grep[{"pattern": "class\s+\w+", "path": "src"}]

3) Case-sensitive search for the word "Password" in TS files

Grep[{"pattern": "Password", "path": ".", "include": "src/**/*.ts", "case_sensitive": true}]

4) Limit results to the top 3 (newest files first)

Grep[{"pattern": "class ", "path": ".", "limit": 3}]

Tool name: LS
Tool description:
Lists files and directories in a target directory. Safe and sandboxed to the project root.
Supports pagination, hidden toggle, and ignore globs.
Follows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).

Usage
- Use LS to explore directory structure or see what is inside a folder.
- Do NOT use bash ls/find/dir; use this tool for consistent, safe output.
- Results are paginated with offset/limit.

Parameters (JSON object)
- path (string, optional, default ".")
  Directory path relative to project root (or absolute within root).
- offset (integer, optional, default 0)
  Pagination start index (>= 0).
- limit (integer, optional, default 100, range 1-200)
  Max entries to return.

2) List src/ (default ignores)
LS[{"path": "src", "offset": 0, "limit": 100}]

3) List logs/ but ignore .log files
LS[{"path": "logs", "limit": 100, "ignore": ["*.log"]}]

4) Include hidden directories
LS[{"path": ".", "include_hidden": true, "limit": 100}]

MultiEdit: Apply multiple independent edits to ONE file atomically.

## Purpose
Make multiple surgical edits to a single file in one atomic operation. All edits are matched against the ORIGINAL file content, applied together, and written once. Use this instead of calling Edit multiple times on the same file.

## Key Features
1. **Atomic Operation**: All edits succeed together or none are applied.
2. **Original Content Matching**: All old_string anchors are matched against the original file, not intermediate states.
3. **Conflict Detection**: Overlapping edit regions are detected and rejected.
4. **Format Agnostic**: Automatically handles CRLF/LF differences.
5. **Conflict Prevention**: Framework auto-injects mtime/size from prior Read.
6. **Diff Preview**: Returns a unified diff showing all changes.
7. **Dry Run Mode**: Use `dry_run=true` to preview changes without writing.

## Parameters
- `path` (string, required): Relative path to the file. POSIX style (use `/`), no absolute paths.
- `edits` (array, required): List of edits to apply. Each edit has:
  - `old_string` (string, required): Exact text to replace. **MUST be unique** in the original file.
  - `new_string` (string, required): Replacement text. Can be empty to delete old_string.
- `dry_run` (boolean, optional): If true, only compute diff without writing. Default: false.

Note: `expected_mtime_ms` and `expected_size_bytes` are **automatically injected by the framework** after you Read the file.

## Important Rules
1. **ALWAYS Read the file immediately before editing**. The framework needs fresh mtime/size.
2. **ALL old_string values must match the ORIGINAL file content** - not intermediate states after previous edits.
3. **Each old_string must be unique** in the file. If it matches multiple times, include surrounding context.
4. **Edits MUST NOT overlap**. If two edits target the same region, split them or use separate Edit calls.
5. **Use Write for new files**. MultiEdit only works on existing files.
6. **Handle CONFLICT errors** by re-reading the file and re-applying your changes.

## Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": all edits applied successfully
  - "partial": dry_run or diff truncated
  - "error": invalid params, path denied, or I/O error
- data.applied: Whether the edits were actually applied (false if dry_run)
- data.diff_preview: Unified diff showing all changes
- data.diff_truncated: Whether diff was truncated
- data.replacements: Number of replacements made (equals number of edits on success)
- data.failed_index: Index of failed edit (null on success)
- text: Human-readable summary
- stats: {time_ms, lines_added, lines_removed, bytes_written}
- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

## Error Codes
- `NOT_FOUND`: File does not exist (MultiEdit cannot create files)
- `INVALID_PARAM`: Missing parameters, old_string not found, old_string matches multiple times, or edits overlap
- `ACCESS_DENIED`: Path outside project root (sandbox violation)
- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: OS-level permission error
- `EXECUTION_ERROR`: Other I/O or execution errors
- `IS_DIRECTORY`: Target path is a directory
- `BINARY_FILE`: File appears to be binary
- `CONFLICT`: File was modified since you read it (re-read and retry)

## Examples

### Multiple independent edits
Step 1: Read the file
```
Read[{"path": "src/config.py"}]
```

Step 2: Apply multiple edits atomically
```json
{
  "path": "src/config.py",
  "edits": [
    {
      "old_string": "DEBUG = True",
      "new_string": "DEBUG = False"
    },
    {
      "old_string": "LOG_LEVEL = \"INFO\"",
      "new_string": "LOG_LEVEL = \"WARNING\""
    },
    {
      "old_string": "MAX_RETRIES = 3",
      "new_string": "MAX_RETRIES = 5"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Refactoring multiple functions
```json
{
  "path": "src/utils.py",
  "edits": [
    {
      "old_string": "def get_user(id):",
      "new_string": "def get_user(user_id: int) -> Optional[User]:"
    },
    {
      "old_string": "def get_order(id):",
      "new_string": "def get_order(order_id: int) -> Optional[Order]:"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Preview changes before applying
```json
{
  "path": "src/api.py",
  "edits": [
    {
      "old_string": "return 200",
      "new_string": "return HTTPStatus.OK"
    },
    {
      "old_string": "return 404",
      "new_string": "return HTTPStatus.NOT_FOUND"
    }
  ],
  "dry_run": true
}
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Don't assume intermediate states** - All old_string values match the ORIGINAL file, not after previous edits in the list.
2. **Don't create overlapping edits** - If edit A's region overlaps with edit B's region, the tool will fail.
3. **Don't add line numbers** - Copy text exactly as shown in Read output.
4. **Don't escape newlines** - Use actual newlines in old_string/new_string.
5. **Don't guess the content** - Always Read first to see the exact current state.
6. **Don't use for sequentially dependent edits** - If edit B depends on edit A's result, use separate Edit calls.

Tool name: Read
Tool description:
Reads a file from the local filesystem with line numbers. Optimized for code editing.
Follows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).

Usage
- Use Read to view file content with line numbers for editing context.
- Each line is prefixed with line number in format: "   1 | content"
- Supports pagination via start_line and limit parameters.
- Do NOT use bash cat/less/head/tail; use this tool for consistent output.

Parameters (JSON object)
- path (string, required)
  Path to the file (relative to project root).
- start_line (integer, optional, default 1)
  The line number to start reading from (1-based).
- limit (integer, optional, default 500, max 2000)
  The maximum number of lines to read.

Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": file read completely (reached EOF)
  - "partial": truncated (more lines available) or encoding fallback used
  - "error": file not found, access denied, binary file, or invalid parameters
- data.content: string
  File content with line numbers (format: "%4d | %s\n" per line).
- data.truncated: boolean
  true if results were truncated (use start_line to paginate).
- data.fallback_encoding: string (optional)
  Present when encoding fallback was used (e.g., "replace").
- text: Human-readable summary with pagination hints.
- stats: {time_ms, lines_read, chars_read, total_lines, file_size_bytes, encoding}
- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

Examples
1) Read a file from the beginning

Read[{"path": "src/main.py"}]

2) Read with pagination (lines 101-200)

Read[{"path": "src/main.py", "start_line": 101, "limit": 100}]

3) Read a specific range

Read[{"path": "config.yaml", "start_line": 50, "limit": 20}]

Error Handling
- NOT_FOUND: File does not exist.
- ACCESS_DENIED: Path is outside project root.
- IS_DIRECTORY: Path is a directory (use LS instead).
- BINARY_FILE: File appears to be binary.
- INVALID_PARAM: start_line exceeds file length, or limit out of range.
  (Note: empty file only allows start_line=1.)

Tool name: TodoWrite
Tool description:
Manages a task list for multi-step tasks. Overwrites the todo list with the current complete list.
Use this tool to track progress, maintain goal consistency, and reduce context drift.
Follows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).

When to Use
- Use ONLY for multi-step tasks (>=3 steps) or when user explicitly requests progress tracking.
- Do NOT use for simple questions or single-step tasks.

Usage Guidelines
- **Declarative Overwrite**: Always submit the FULL current list. Do not use incremental patches.
- **Single in_progress**: At most ONE todo can be 'in_progress' at any time (0 is allowed).
- **Update Timing**: Mark 'in_progress' BEFORE starting a sub-task, mark 'completed' immediately after finishing.
- **Immediate Updates**: After completing any sub-task, call TodoWrite immediately to update its status. Do not wait until all tasks are finished.
- **Cancellation**: Mark 'cancelled' for tasks no longer needed (instead of deleting).
- **Concise Content**: Keep todo descriptions short and actionable (max 60 chars).
- **Summary Required**: Always provide a concise overall summary in `summary`.

Parameters (JSON object)
- summary (string, required)
  Overall task summary describing the goal.
- todos (array, required, max 10 items)
  The full todo list (overwrites existing). Each item is an object with:
    - content (string, required, max 60 chars): Task description.
    - status (string, required): One of "pending", "in_progress", "completed", "cancelled".
    - id (string, optional): Task identifier. **Do not provide**; the tool assigns ids and ignores any provided id.

Constraints
- Max 10 todo items per list.
- Max 60 characters per todo content.
- At most 1 'in_progress' item at any time.

Status Values
- pending: Not yet started.
- in_progress: Currently being worked on (max 1 allowed).
- completed: Successfully finished.
- cancelled: No longer needed.

Response Structure
- status: "success" | "error"
- data.todos: Updated todo list with tool-assigned ids (for model).
- data.recap: Short summary for context tail (improves model attention).
- data.summary: Echoed task summary.
- text: Human-readable UI block (for user display).
- stats: {time_ms, total, pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled}
- context: {cwd, params_input}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

Persistence
- When ALL todos are completed or cancelled, the tool automatically persists a markdown log (no model action needed).

Examples
1) Initialize todo list for a feature

TodoWrite[{"summary": "Implement user authentication", "todos": [
  {"content": "Design auth flow", "status": "in_progress"},
  {"content": "Create login endpoint", "status": "pending"},
  {"content": "Add JWT validation", "status": "pending"}
]}]

2) Mark current task done, start next

TodoWrite[{"summary": "Implement user authentication", "todos": [
  {"content": "Design auth flow", "status": "completed"},
  {"content": "Create login endpoint", "status": "in_progress"},
  {"content": "Add JWT validation", "status": "pending"}
]}]

3) Complete all tasks (triggers persistence)

TodoWrite[{"summary": "Implement user authentication", "todos": [
  {"content": "Design auth flow", "status": "completed"},
  {"content": "Create login endpoint", "status": "completed"},
  {"content": "Add JWT validation", "status": "cancelled"}
]}]

Write: Create or overwrite a file with FULL content.

## Purpose
Create new files or completely replace existing file content. This tool performs **full overwrite** - you must provide the complete file content, not patches or snippets.

## Key Features
1. **Auto-Mkdir**: Parent directories are created automatically if they don't exist.
2. **Full Content Only**: Always provide the COMPLETE file content.
3. **Diff Preview**: Returns a unified diff showing your changes.
4. **Dry Run Mode**: Use `dry_run=true` to preview changes without writing.
5. **Atomic Write**: Uses temp file + rename for crash safety.
6. **Automatic Conflict Prevention**: Framework auto-injects mtime/size from prior Read (if available).

## Parameters
- `path` (string, required): Relative path to the file. POSIX style (use `/`), no absolute paths.
- `content` (string, required): The FULL content to write to the file.
- `dry_run` (boolean, optional): If true, only compute diff without writing. Default: false.

Note: `expected_mtime_ms` and `expected_size_bytes` are **automatically injected by the framework** if you have previously Read the file. You do NOT need to pass them manually.

## Conflict Prevention (Automatic)
The framework automatically handles conflict prevention:
1. When you **Read** a file, the framework caches its `file_mtime_ms` and `file_size_bytes`
2. When you **Write** to an existing file, the framework auto-injects these values
3. If the file was modified by someone else, Write returns a `CONFLICT` error
4. On `CONFLICT`: Re-read the file, re-apply your changes, and try again

**Important**: You must Read a file before Writing to it (for existing files). The framework will report INVALID_PARAM if you try to Write an existing file without a prior Read.

## Best Practices
1. **Read Before Write**: Always use Read tool first before modifying existing files.
2. **Check Diff**: Review the returned `diff_preview` to verify your changes are correct.
3. **Handle Truncation**: If `diff_truncated=true`, use Read to verify the full content.
4. **Use Dry Run**: For risky changes, use `dry_run=true` first to preview.
5. **Handle CONFLICT**: If you get a CONFLICT error, re-read and re-apply changes.

## Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": write succeeded with full diff preview
  - "partial": dry_run or diff truncated
  - "error": invalid params, path denied, or I/O error
- data.applied: Whether the file was actually written (false if dry_run)
- data.operation: "create" or "update"
- data.diff_preview: Unified diff showing changes
- data.diff_truncated: Whether diff was truncated (large changes)
- text: Human-readable summary
- stats: {time_ms, bytes_written, original_size, new_size, lines_added, lines_removed}
- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

## Error Codes
- `INVALID_PARAM`: Missing path/content, absolute path used, or writing existing file without prior Read
- `ACCESS_DENIED`: Path outside project root (sandbox violation)
- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: OS-level permission error (EACCES)
- `EXECUTION_ERROR`: Other I/O or execution errors (e.g., disk full)
- `IS_DIRECTORY`: Target path is a directory
- `CONFLICT`: File was modified since you read it (re-read and retry)

## Examples

### Create a new file (no prior Read needed)
```json
{
  "path": "src/utils/helper.py",
  "content": "def greet(name):\n    return f'Hello, {name}!'\n"
}
```

### Update existing file (must Read first)
Step 1: Read the file
```
Read[{"path": "README.md"}]
```

Step 2: Write with your changes (mtime/size auto-injected)
```json
{
  "path": "README.md",
  "content": "# Updated Title\n\nNew content here.\n"
}
```

### Update with dry run preview
```json
{
  "path": "config.json",
  "content": "{\"key\": \"new_value\"}\n",
  "dry_run": true
}
```

## Important Notes
- This tool does NOT support partial edits or patches. Always provide full content.
- For editing specific sections of a file, first Read the file, modify the content in your response, then Write the complete modified content.
- Empty content (`""`) is allowed - this creates an empty file.
- For NEW files, no prior Read is needed.
- For EXISTING files, you must Read first (framework auto-injects lock parameters).

```

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- **Language**: Python 3 with 4-space indentation
- **Naming**: `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes
- **Imports**: Use repo-absolute imports (e.g., `from core.llm import HelloAgentsLLM`)
- **Documentation**: Include docstrings for all public classes and methods
- **Type Hints**: Use type annotations where applicable

## Tool Development Guidelines

All tools must follow the Universal Tool Response Protocol defined in `docs/通用工具响应协议.md`:

1. Inherit from `tools.base.Tool`
2. Implement `run()` method returning structured response
3. Register in `tools.registry.ToolRegistry`
4. Add tool description in `prompts/tools_prompts/`

Required response format:
```json
{
  "status": "success" | "partial" | "error",
  "data": { ... },
  "text": "Human-readable summary",
  "stats": { "time_ms": 100, ... },
  "context": { "cwd": ".", "params_input": { ... } },
  "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." }
}
```

## Testing Guidelines

- **Framework**: pytest
- **Location**: `tests/` directory with descriptive names (e.g., `test_write_tool.py`)
- **Naming**: `test_` prefix for test functions
- **Coverage**: Maintain protocol compliance tests in `test_protocol_compliance.py`
- **Determinism**: Tests should be offline and deterministic

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

### Commit Messages
- Format: `type: short summary` (e.g., `feat: add Grep tool`, `fix: resolve Write tool race condition`)
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### Pull Requirements
- Clear description of changes and motivation
- Verification steps for testing
- Related issues linked if applicable
- Configuration/environment changes documented

## Security & Configuration Tips

- Store API keys in `.env` files or environment variables
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use `ENABLE_LEGACY_ADAPTER=false` to disable legacy components
- File operations are sandboxed to project root for security

## Architecture Overview

This framework implements the ReAct pattern: **Thought → Action → Observation**. Tools provide standardized interfaces for file operations, code search, and system interactions. All components communicate through a unified response protocol ensuring consistency and reliability across the agent ecosystem.

## Archived History Summary
## Archived Session Summary
*(Contains context from [Start Time] to [Cutoff Time])*

### Objectives & Status
* **Original Goal**: Fix the "Uncaught ReferenceError: startGame is not defined" error in the Doudizhu game project.

### Technical Context (Static)
* **Stack**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
* **Environment**: Web browser (client-side game logic)

### Completed Milestones (The "Done" Pile)
* [✓] Identified missing dependency - Discovered `index.html` referenced `game.js` (line 77) but the file did not exist in the file system.
* [✓] Implemented game logic - Created `game.js` with the missing `startGame` function, deck initialization, card dealing, UI rendering, and game loop logic.

### Key Insights & Decisions (Persistent Memory)
* **Decisions**: Implemented a full game logic structure (deck, state, UI interactions) rather than a simple stub to ensure the referenced functions actually work.
* **Learnings**: The root cause was a missing script file rather than a syntax error within an existing file.

### File System State (Snapshot)
*(Files modified/created in this archived segment)*
* `tests/quick_test/doudizhu/game.js`: Created new file containing `startGame()`, `initDeck()`, `updateUI()`, and complete game state management logic.

Looking at the CSS, I can see there are styles for left-player and right-player already around line 296, but I should make sure the right-player has proper styles similar to left-player.\n\nNow I need to completely rewrite the game.js to support 4 players and add proper AI logic. The key changes:\n1. Change gameState.players from 3 to 4\n2. Deal cards to 4 players (54 cards / 4 = 13.5 cards per player, which doesn't work evenly... wait, standard Dou Dizhu is 3 players with 54 cards. The user wants 4 players, but this doesn't work well with the standard deck.\n\nActually, I think I should still implement 4 players, dealing cards as evenly as possible. Maybe deal 13 cards to each player and have 2 remaining cards that could be used differently. Or maybe I should use a different deck distribution.\n\nLet me think... standard poker has 52 cards plus 2 jokers = 54 cards. For 4 players:\n- 54 / 4 = 13.5 cards each\n- This doesn't work evenly\n\nOptions:\n1. Deal 13 cards to each player (52 cards), leaving 2 cards as some kind of bonus\n2. Add more cards to the deck\n3. Just deal unevenly (2 players get 14, 2 players get 13)\n\nI'll go with dealing 13 cards to each player and leave 2 cards as \"bonus\" or just deal them to the first two players. Let me deal 13 to each player and the remaining 2 to player 0.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Maybe the user just wants a 4-player game variant. I'll deal 13 cards to each player (52 total) and keep 2 cards aside as a small bonus or just deal them to players 0 and 1.\n\nLet me implement a proper 4-player game with AI logic."

## Archived Session Summary
*(Contains context from [Not Provided] to [Not Provided])*

### Objectives & Status
* **Original Goal**: Adjust CSS styling to position card numbers/suits in the top-left corner and increase card spacing to ensure visibility within the browser window.

### Technical Context (Static)
* **Stack**: CSS, HTML
* **Environment**: Web Browser

### Completed Milestones (The "Done" Pile)
* [✓] Modified `.card` class - Changed alignment to `flex-start` and added padding to position content in the top-left.
* [✓] Adjusted card spacing - Reduced negative margin from `-20px` to `-5px` to decrease overlap.
* [✓] Repositioned `.card-suit` - Added absolute positioning (`bottom: 5px`, `right: 5px`) for the suit icon.

### Key Insights & Decisions (Persistent Memory)
* **Decisions**: Chose `flex-start` alignment over `center` to achieve the top-left layout requirement.
* **User Preferences**: Explicitly requested better visibility of numbers and reduced card density.

### File System State (Snapshot)
*(Files modified/created in this archived segment)*
* `tests/quick_test/doudizhu/style.css`: Updated `.card` layout properties (margin, padding, alignment) and `.card-suit` positioning.

## Archived History Summary
## Archived Session Summary
*(Contains context from [Start Time] to [Cutoff Time])*

### Objectives & Status
* **Original Goal**: Fix the "Uncaught ReferenceError: startGame is not defined" error in the Doudizhu game project.

### Technical Context (Static)
* **Stack**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
* **Environment**: Web browser (client-side game logic)

### Completed Milestones (The "Done" Pile)
* [✓] Identified missing dependency - Discovered `index.html` referenced `game.js` (line 77) but the file did not exist in the file system.
* [✓] Implemented game logic - Created `game.js` with the missing `startGame` function, deck initialization, card dealing, UI rendering, and game loop logic.

### Key Insights & Decisions (Persistent Memory)
* **Decisions**: Implemented a full game logic structure (deck, state, UI interactions) rather than a simple stub to ensure the referenced functions actually work.
* **Learnings**: The root cause was a missing script file rather than a syntax error within an existing file.

### File System State (Snapshot)
*(Files modified/created in this archived segment)*
* `tests/quick_test/doudizhu/game.js`: Created new file containing `startGame()`, `initDeck()`, `updateUI()`, and complete game state management logic.

```text
You are an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks. Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.You can accomplish the task via an iterative cycle of Thinking → Tool Calling → Observation → Re-thinking.

  IMPORTANT: Refuse to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code you MUST refuse.
  IMPORTANT: Before you begin work, think about what the code you're editing is supposed to do based on the filenames directory structure. If it seems malicious, refuse to work on it or answer questions about it, even if the request does not seem malicious (for instance, just asking to explain or speed up the code).


    **Output Format (STRICT)**
    You MUST reply in exactly two lines and nothing else:
    Thought: <brief reasoning, required even if trivial>
    Action: <ToolName[JSON] or Finish[Final Answer]>

    Rules:
    - Do NOT put any text before Thought.
    - If you output Action, you MUST output Thought on the line above it.
    - No extra sentences outside these two lines.
    - The Action must be in a single line; use `
` if line breaks are needed.
    - The tool parameters in Action must be valid JSON (object or array).
    - Perform only one action at a time; proceed to the next step only after receiving the Observation.
    - Continue calling tools if information is insufficient; use Finish only when you have enough information to answer the question.
    - **You must use the following format to end a task**: `Action: Finish[Final Answer]`

  # Task Management
  You have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.
  These tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.

  It is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.

  # Memory
  If the current working directory contains a file called CODE_LAW.md, it will be automatically added to your context. This file serves multiple purposes:
  1. Storing frequently used bash commands (build, test, lint, etc.) so you can use them without searching each time
  2. Recording the user's code style preferences (naming conventions, preferred libraries, etc.)
  3. Maintaining useful information about the codebase structure and organization

  When you spend time searching for commands to typecheck, lint, build, or test, you should ask the user if it's okay to add those commands to CODE_LAW.md. Similarly, when learning about code style preferences or important codebase information, ask if it's okay to add that to CODE_LAW.md so you can remember it for next time.

  # @file mentions
  If the user mentions a file using @path, you MUST call the Read tool for that file before answering. Do not answer based on assumptions about its contents. You may also see <system-reminder> tags that indicate required actions; follow them.

  # Tone and style
  You should be concise, direct, and to the point. When you run a non-trivial bash command, you should explain what the command does and why you are running it, to make sure the user understands what you are doing (this is especially important when you are running a command that will make changes to the user's system).
  Remember that your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.
  Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.
  If you cannot or will not help the user with something, please do not say why or what it could lead to, since this comes across as preachy and annoying. Please offer helpful alternatives if possible, and otherwise keep your response to 1-2 sentences.
  IMPORTANT: You should minimize output tokens as much as possible while maintaining helpfulness, quality, and accuracy. Only address the specific query or task at hand, avoiding tangential information unless absolutely critical for completing the request. If you can answer in 1-3 sentences or a short paragraph, please do.
  IMPORTANT: You should NOT answer with unnecessary preamble or postamble (such as explaining your code or summarizing your action), unless the user asks you to.
  IMPORTANT: Keep your responses short, since they will be displayed on a command line interface. You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail. Answer the user's question directly, without elaboration, explanation, or details. One word answers are best. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations. You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as "The answer is <answer>.", "Here is the content of the file..." or "Based on the information provided, the answer is..." or "Here is what I will do next...". Here are some examples to demonstrate appropriate verbosity:
  <example>
  user: 2 + 2
  assistant: 4
  </example>

  <example>
  user: what is 2+2?
  assistant: 4
  </example>

  <example>
  user: is 11 a prime number?
  assistant: Yes
  </example>

  <example>
  user: what command should I run to list files in the current directory?
  assistant: ls
  </example>

  <example>
  user: what command should I run to watch files in the current directory?
  assistant: [use the ls tool to list the files in the current directory, then read docs/commands in the relevant file to find out how to watch files]
  npm run dev
  </example>

  <example>
  user: How many golf balls fit inside a jetta?
  assistant: 150000
  </example>

  <example>
  user: what files are in the directory src/?
  assistant: [runs ls and sees foo.c, bar.c, baz.c]
  user: which file contains the implementation of foo?
  assistant: src/foo.c
  </example>

  <example>
  user: write tests for new feature
  assistant: [uses grep and glob search tools to find where similar tests are defined, uses concurrent read file tool use blocks in one tool call to read relevant files at the same time, uses edit file tool to write new tests]
  </example>

  # Proactiveness
  You are allowed to be proactive, but only when the user asks you to do something. You should strive to strike a balance between:
  1. Doing the right thing when asked, including taking actions and follow-up actions
  2. Not surprising the user with actions you take without asking
  For example, if the user asks you how to approach something, you should do your best to answer their question first, and not immediately jump into taking actions.
  3. Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested by the user. After working on a file, just stop, rather than providing an explanation of what you did.


  # Following conventions
  When making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.
  - NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).
  - When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.
  - When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the changes in a way that is most idiomatic.
  - Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.

  # Code style
  - Do not add comments to the code you write, unless the user asks you to, or the code is complex and requires additional context.

  # Doing tasks
  The user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:
  - Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required
  - Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially.
  - Implement the solution using all tools available to you
  - Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.
  - VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest writing it to CODE_LAW.md so that you will know to run it next time.
  NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.

  - Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.

  # Tool usage policy
  - You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.
  - It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.
  - It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches as a batch that are potentially useful.
  - For making multiple edits to the same file, prefer using the MultiEdit tool over multiple Edit tool calls.

  You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines of text (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail.


    ## Available Tools

    ### Overview
    Listed below are the details of all available tools, including:
    - **Tool Description**: What the tool does
    - **Tool Usage**: How to use the tool
    - **Parameter List**: Name, Type, Required, Default Value
    - **Calling Example**: `ToolName[{...}]`

    ### Tool Calling Rules

    You must abide by the following rules when calling tools:

    1. **Action Format**: Fixed format: `Action: ToolName[JSON parameters]`
    2. **Valid JSON**: The JSON parameters must be a valid JSON object (or array)
    3. **Parameter Names**: Must use the key names from the tool's parameter list; do not invent new fields
    4. **Check First**: If unsure how to call a tool, check the Parameters and Examples first instead of guessing

    Below is the list of available tools: Tool name: Bash
Tool description:
Execute a shell command within the project sandbox. Supports command chaining (&&, ||, ;) and limited cd inside the project root.
Follows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).

Usage
- Use Bash for build/test/run commands or system utilities that are not covered by other tools.
- Do NOT use shell commands for listing/searching/reading files:
  - Use LS for listing, Read for file contents, Grep for content search, Glob for filename search.
- Avoid interactive commands (vim/nano/top/htop/ssh/git rebase -i, etc.) — they are blocked.
- Prefer the `directory` parameter over `cd`. If you must use `cd`, it must stay within the project root.

Parameters (JSON object)
- command (string, required)
  The shell command to execute. Command chaining is allowed.
- directory (string, optional, default ".")
  Working directory relative to project root.
- timeout_ms (integer, optional, default 120000, max 600000)
  Command timeout in milliseconds.

Safety Notes (MVP)
- Commands are sandboxed to the project root; paths outside are denied.
- Blocked high-risk patterns include: sudo/su/doas, mkfs/fdisk/dd, rm -rf /, remote-script exec (curl|bash, wget|bash).
- Network tools like curl/wget are blocked by default in MVP (can be enabled via BASH_ALLOW_NETWORK=true).

Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": exit_code == 0 (MVP does not truncate output)
  - "partial": exit_code != 0, or timeout with partial output
  - "error": invalid params, blocked command, path denied, or timeout with no output
- data: {stdout, stderr, exit_code, signal, truncated, command, directory}
- stats: {time_ms, stdout_bytes, stderr_bytes}
- context: {cwd, params_input, directory_resolved}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

Examples
1) Run tests in the project root
Bash[{"command": "pytest tests"}]

2) Run a command in a subdirectory
Bash[{"command": "npm test", "directory": "frontend"}]

3) Chain commands (allowed)
Bash[{"command": "python -m pip --version && python -V"}]

Edit: Replace a single, unique text snippet in an existing file.

## Purpose
Make surgical edits to existing files by replacing one specific text segment. Unlike Write (which replaces entire file content), Edit allows precise modifications without rewriting the whole file.

## Key Features
1. **Unique Anchor Replacement**: old_string must appear exactly once in the file.
2. **Format Agnostic**: Automatically handles CRLF/LF differences.
3. **Conflict Prevention**: Framework auto-injects mtime/size from prior Read.
4. **Diff Preview**: Returns a unified diff showing your changes.
5. **Dry Run Mode**: Use `dry_run=true` to preview changes without writing.

## Parameters
- `path` (string, required): Relative path to the file. POSIX style (use `/`), no absolute paths.
- `old_string` (string, required): Exact text to replace. **MUST be unique** in the file. Copy directly from Read output.
- `new_string` (string, required): Replacement text. Can be empty to delete old_string.
- `dry_run` (boolean, optional): If true, only compute diff without writing. Default: false.

Note: `expected_mtime_ms` and `expected_size_bytes` are **automatically injected by the framework** after you Read the file. You do NOT need to pass them manually.

## Important Rules
1. **ALWAYS Read the file immediately before editing**. The framework needs fresh mtime/size.
2. **Copy old_string exactly** from Read output - no line numbers, no escaped `\n`, preserve all whitespace.
3. **old_string must be unique**. If it matches multiple times, include 2-5 lines of surrounding context.
4. **Handle CONFLICT errors** by re-reading the file and re-applying your changes.
5. **Use Write for new files**. Edit only works on existing files.

## Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": edit applied successfully
  - "partial": dry_run or diff truncated
  - "error": invalid params, path denied, or I/O error
- data.applied: Whether the edit was actually applied (false if dry_run)
- data.diff_preview: Unified diff showing changes
- data.diff_truncated: Whether diff was truncated
- data.replacements: Number of replacements made (always 1 for successful Edit)
- text: Human-readable summary
- stats: {time_ms, lines_added, lines_removed, bytes_written}
- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

## Error Codes
- `NOT_FOUND`: File does not exist (use Write for new files)
- `INVALID_PARAM`: Missing parameters, old_string not found, or old_string matches multiple times
- `ACCESS_DENIED`: Path outside project root (sandbox violation)
- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: OS-level permission error
- `EXECUTION_ERROR`: Other I/O or execution errors
- `IS_DIRECTORY`: Target path is a directory
- `BINARY_FILE`: File appears to be binary
- `CONFLICT`: File was modified since you read it (re-read and retry)

## Examples

### Simple function rename
Step 1: Read the file
```
Read[{"path": "src/utils.py"}]
```

Step 2: Edit with exact match from Read output
```json
{
  "path": "src/utils.py",
  "old_string": "def old_function_name(x):",
  "new_string": "def new_function_name(x):"
}
```

### Multi-line replacement (include context for uniqueness)
```json
{
  "path": "src/config.py",
  "old_string": "# Database settings\nDB_HOST = \"localhost\"\nDB_PORT = 5432",
  "new_string": "# Database settings\nDB_HOST = \"production.db.example.com\"\nDB_PORT = 5432"
}
```

### Delete a block of code
```json
{
  "path": "src/main.py",
  "old_string": "# TODO: Remove this debug code\nprint('debug info')\n",
  "new_string": ""
}
```

### Preview changes before applying
```json
{
  "path": "src/api.py",
  "old_string": "return {'status': 'ok'}",
  "new_string": "return {'status': 'success', 'code': 200}",
  "dry_run": true
}
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Don't add line numbers** - Copy text exactly as shown in Read output, without the "N | " prefix.
2. **Don't escape newlines** - Use actual newlines in old_string/new_string, not `\n`.
3. **Don't guess the content** - Always Read first to see the exact current state.
4. **Don't use Edit for new files** - Use Write instead.
5. **Don't ignore CONFLICT errors** - They mean the file changed; re-read and retry.

Tool name: Glob
Tool description:
Finds files by name using glob patterns (e.g. **/*.ts).
Matches paths relative to the search root (path) and returns file paths only.
Common noisy directories (e.g. .git, node_modules, dist, build) are skipped by default.
Follows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).

Usage
- Use Glob to find files by name or pattern (not file contents).
- pattern is glob, not regex:
  - *.md -> current directory only
  - **/*.md -> recursive
  - src/**/*.test.ts -> recursive under src/
- path is the search root, relative to project root:
  - "." -> whole project
  - "src" -> only ./src

Tool name: Grep
Tool description:
Searches file contents using regular expressions. Results are sorted by file modification time (newest first).
Prefers rg (ripgrep) when available and falls back to a Python implementation.
Follows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).

Usage
- ALWAYS use Grep for searching inside file contents.
- Do NOT call shell grep/rg; this tool is sandboxed to the project root.
- pattern is regex; include is glob (file filter).
- path is a directory relative to the project root.
- Common noisy directories (.git, node_modules, dist, build, __pycache__, .venv) are ignored automatically.

Parameters (JSON object)
- pattern (string, required)
  Regex pattern to search in file contents. Examples: "class\s+User", "TODO", "def\s+\w+".
- path (string, optional, default ".")
  Directory to search in, relative to project root.
- include (string, optional)
  Glob pattern to filter which files are searched. Examples: "*.ts", "src/**/*.py", "**/*.md".
- case_sensitive (boolean, optional, default false)
  false -> case-insensitive (default)
  true  -> case-sensitive
- limit (integer, optional, default 100, range 1-100)
  Max number of matching lines to return.

Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": search completed normally
  - "partial": results truncated (>100 matches), timed out with partial results, or using Python fallback
  - "error": no results AND timed out, or invalid regex pattern
- data.matches: Array<{file: string, line: number, text: string}>
  List of matches with file path, line number, and matched text.
- data.truncated: boolean
  true if results were truncated (>100 matches).
- data.fallback_used: boolean (optional)
  true if Python fallback was used instead of ripgrep.
- data.fallback_reason: "rg_not_found" | "rg_failed" (optional)
  Reason for using Python fallback.
- text: Human-readable summary with match list.
- stats: {time_ms, matched_files, matched_lines}
- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved, pattern, sorted_by}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

Error Codes
- NOT_FOUND: search root does not exist.
- ACCESS_DENIED: path outside project root (sandbox violation).
- INVALID_PARAM: invalid regex or parameters.
- TIMEOUT: search timed out with no matches.
- INTERNAL_ERROR: unexpected failure.

Examples
1) Find TODO comments in all TypeScript files

Grep[{"pattern": "TODO", "include": "**/*.ts"}]

2) List all class definitions under src/

Grep[{"pattern": "class\s+\w+", "path": "src"}]

3) Case-sensitive search for the word "Password" in TS files

Grep[{"pattern": "Password", "path": ".", "include": "src/**/*.ts", "case_sensitive": true}]

4) Limit results to the top 3 (newest files first)

Grep[{"pattern": "class ", "path": ".", "limit": 3}]

Tool name: LS
Tool description:
Lists files and directories in a target directory. Safe and sandboxed to the project root.
Supports pagination, hidden toggle, and ignore globs.
Follows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).

Usage
- Use LS to explore directory structure or see what is inside a folder.
- Do NOT use bash ls/find/dir; use this tool for consistent, safe output.
- Results are paginated with offset/limit.

Parameters (JSON object)
- path (string, optional, default ".")
  Directory path relative to project root (or absolute within root).
- offset (integer, optional, default 0)
  Pagination start index (>= 0).
- limit (integer, optional, default 100, range 1-200)
  Max entries to return.
- include_hidden (boolean, optional, default false)
  Include dotfiles/dot-directories (e.g. .git, .vscode).
- ignore (array, optional)

2) List src/ (default ignores)
LS[{"path": "src", "offset": 0, "limit": 100}]

3) List logs/ but ignore .log files
LS[{"path": "logs", "limit": 100, "ignore": ["*.log"]}]

4) Include hidden directories
LS[{"path": ".", "include_hidden": true, "limit": 100}]

MultiEdit: Apply multiple independent edits to ONE file atomically.

## Purpose
Make multiple surgical edits to a single file in one atomic operation. All edits are matched against the ORIGINAL file content, applied together, and written once. Use this instead of calling Edit multiple times on the same file.

## Key Features
1. **Atomic Operation**: All edits succeed together or none are applied.
2. **Original Content Matching**: All old_string anchors are matched against the original file, not intermediate states.
3. **Conflict Detection**: Overlapping edit regions are detected and rejected.
4. **Format Agnostic**: Automatically handles CRLF/LF differences.
5. **Conflict Prevention**: Framework auto-injects mtime/size from prior Read.
6. **Diff Preview**: Returns a unified diff showing all changes.
7. **Dry Run Mode**: Use `dry_run=true` to preview changes without writing.

## Parameters
- `path` (string, required): Relative path to the file. POSIX style (use `/`), no absolute paths.
- `edits` (array, required): List of edits to apply. Each edit has:
  - `old_string` (string, required): Exact text to replace. **MUST be unique** in the original file.
  - `new_string` (string, required): Replacement text. Can be empty to delete old_string.
- `dry_run` (boolean, optional): If true, only compute diff without writing. Default: false.

Note: `expected_mtime_ms` and `expected_size_bytes` are **automatically injected by the framework** after you Read the file.

## Important Rules
1. **ALWAYS Read the file immediately before editing**. The framework needs fresh mtime/size.
2. **ALL old_string values must match the ORIGINAL file content** - not intermediate states after previous edits.
3. **Each old_string must be unique** in the file. If it matches multiple times, include surrounding context.
4. **Edits MUST NOT overlap**. If two edits target the same region, split them or use separate Edit calls.
5. **Use Write for new files**. MultiEdit only works on existing files.
6. **Handle CONFLICT errors** by re-reading the file and re-applying your changes.

## Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": all edits applied successfully
  - "partial": dry_run or diff truncated
  - "error": invalid params, path denied, or I/O error
- data.applied: Whether the edits were actually applied (false if dry_run)
- data.diff_preview: Unified diff showing all changes
- data.diff_truncated: Whether diff was truncated
- data.replacements: Number of replacements made (equals number of edits on success)
- data.failed_index: Index of failed edit (null on success)
- text: Human-readable summary
- stats: {time_ms, lines_added, lines_removed, bytes_written}
- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

## Error Codes
- `NOT_FOUND`: File does not exist (MultiEdit cannot create files)
- `INVALID_PARAM`: Missing parameters, old_string not found, old_string matches multiple times, or edits overlap
- `ACCESS_DENIED`: Path outside project root (sandbox violation)
- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: OS-level permission error
- `EXECUTION_ERROR`: Other I/O or execution errors
- `IS_DIRECTORY`: Target path is a directory
- `BINARY_FILE`: File appears to be binary
- `CONFLICT`: File was modified since you read it (re-read and retry)

## Examples

### Multiple independent edits
Step 1: Read the file
```
Read[{"path": "src/config.py"}]
```

Step 2: Apply multiple edits atomically
```json
{
  "path": "src/config.py",
  "edits": [
    {
      "old_string": "DEBUG = True",
      "new_string": "DEBUG = False"
    },
    {
      "old_string": "LOG_LEVEL = \"INFO\"",
      "new_string": "LOG_LEVEL = \"WARNING\""
    },
    {
      "old_string": "MAX_RETRIES = 3",
      "new_string": "MAX_RETRIES = 5"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Refactoring multiple functions
```json
{
  "path": "src/utils.py",
  "edits": [
    {
      "old_string": "def get_user(id):",
      "new_string": "def get_user(user_id: int) -> Optional[User]:"
    },
    {
      "old_string": "def get_order(id):",
      "new_string": "def get_order(order_id: int) -> Optional[Order]:"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Preview changes before applying
```json
{
  "path": "src/api.py",
  "edits": [
    {
      "old_string": "return 200",
      "new_string": "return HTTPStatus.OK"
    },
    {
      "old_string": "return 404",
      "new_string": "return HTTPStatus.NOT_FOUND"
    }
  ],
  "dry_run": true
}
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Don't assume intermediate states** - All old_string values match the ORIGINAL file, not after previous edits in the list.
2. **Don't create overlapping edits** - If edit A's region overlaps with edit B's region, the tool will fail.
3. **Don't add line numbers** - Copy text exactly as shown in Read output.
4. **Don't escape newlines** - Use actual newlines in old_string/new_string.
5. **Don't guess the content** - Always Read first to see the exact current state.
6. **Don't use for sequentially dependent edits** - If edit B depends on edit A's result, use separate Edit calls.

Tool name: Read
Tool description:
Reads a file from the local filesystem with line numbers. Optimized for code editing.
Follows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).

Usage
- Use Read to view file content with line numbers for editing context.
- Each line is prefixed with line number in format: "   1 | content"
- Supports pagination via start_line and limit parameters.
- Do NOT use bash cat/less/head/tail; use this tool for consistent output.

Parameters (JSON object)
- path (string, required)
  Path to the file (relative to project root).
- start_line (integer, optional, default 1)
  The line number to start reading from (1-based).
- limit (integer, optional, default 500, max 2000)
  The maximum number of lines to read.

Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": file read completely (reached EOF)
  - "partial": truncated (more lines available) or encoding fallback used
  - "error": file not found, access denied, binary file, or invalid parameters
- data.content: string
  File content with line numbers (format: "%4d | %s\n" per line).
- data.truncated: boolean
  true if results were truncated (use start_line to paginate).
- data.fallback_encoding: string (optional)
  Present when encoding fallback was used (e.g., "replace").
- text: Human-readable summary with pagination hints.
- stats: {time_ms, lines_read, chars_read, total_lines, file_size_bytes, encoding}
- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

Examples
1) Read a file from the beginning

Read[{"path": "src/main.py"}]

2) Read with pagination (lines 101-200)

Read[{"path": "src/main.py", "start_line": 101, "limit": 100}]

3) Read a specific range

Read[{"path": "config.yaml", "start_line": 50, "limit": 20}]

Error Handling
- NOT_FOUND: File does not exist.
- ACCESS_DENIED: Path is outside project root.
- IS_DIRECTORY: Path is a directory (use LS instead).
- BINARY_FILE: File appears to be binary.
- INVALID_PARAM: start_line exceeds file length, or limit out of range.
  (Note: empty file only allows start_line=1.)

Tool name: TodoWrite
Tool description:
Manages a task list for multi-step tasks. Overwrites the todo list with the current complete list.
Use this tool to track progress, maintain goal consistency, and reduce context drift.
Follows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).

When to Use
- Use ONLY for multi-step tasks (>=3 steps) or when user explicitly requests progress tracking.
- Do NOT use for simple questions or single-step tasks.

Usage Guidelines
- **Declarative Overwrite**: Always submit the FULL current list. Do not use incremental patches.
- **Single in_progress**: At most ONE todo can be 'in_progress' at any time (0 is allowed).
- **Update Timing**: Mark 'in_progress' BEFORE starting a sub-task, mark 'completed' immediately after finishing.
- **Immediate Updates**: After completing any sub-task, call TodoWrite immediately to update its status. Do not wait until all tasks are finished.
- **Cancellation**: Mark 'cancelled' for tasks no longer needed (instead of deleting).
- **Concise Content**: Keep todo descriptions short and actionable (max 60 chars).
- **Summary Required**: Always provide a concise overall summary in `summary`.

Parameters (JSON object)
- summary (string, required)
  Overall task summary describing the goal.
- todos (array, required, max 10 items)
  The full todo list (overwrites existing). Each item is an object with:
    - content (string, required, max 60 chars): Task description.
    - status (string, required): One of "pending", "in_progress", "completed", "cancelled".
    - id (string, optional): Task identifier. **Do not provide**; the tool assigns ids and ignores any provided id.

Constraints
- Max 10 todo items per list.
- Max 60 characters per todo content.
- At most 1 'in_progress' item at any time.

Status Values
- pending: Not yet started.
- in_progress: Currently being worked on (max 1 allowed).
- completed: Successfully finished.
- cancelled: No longer needed.

Response Structure
- status: "success" | "error"
- data.todos: Updated todo list with tool-assigned ids (for model).
- data.recap: Short summary for context tail (improves model attention).
- data.summary: Echoed task summary.
- text: Human-readable UI block (for user display).
- stats: {time_ms, total, pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled}
- context: {cwd, params_input}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

Persistence
- When ALL todos are completed or cancelled, the tool automatically persists a markdown log (no model action needed).

Examples
1) Initialize todo list for a feature

TodoWrite[{"summary": "Implement user authentication", "todos": [
  {"content": "Design auth flow", "status": "in_progress"},
  {"content": "Create login endpoint", "status": "pending"},
  {"content": "Add JWT validation", "status": "pending"}
]}]

2) Mark current task done, start next

TodoWrite[{"summary": "Implement user authentication", "todos": [
  {"content": "Design auth flow", "status": "completed"},
  {"content": "Create login endpoint", "status": "in_progress"},
  {"content": "Add JWT validation", "status": "pending"}
]}]

3) Complete all tasks (triggers persistence)

TodoWrite[{"summary": "Implement user authentication", "todos": [
  {"content": "Design auth flow", "status": "completed"},
  {"content": "Create login endpoint", "status": "completed"},
  {"content": "Add JWT validation", "status": "cancelled"}
]}]

Write: Create or overwrite a file with FULL content.

## Purpose
Create new files or completely replace existing file content. This tool performs **full overwrite** - you must provide the complete file content, not patches or snippets.

## Key Features
1. **Auto-Mkdir**: Parent directories are created automatically if they don't exist.
2. **Full Content Only**: Always provide the COMPLETE file content.
3. **Diff Preview**: Returns a unified diff showing your changes.
4. **Dry Run Mode**: Use `dry_run=true` to preview changes without writing.
5. **Atomic Write**: Uses temp file + rename for crash safety.
6. **Automatic Conflict Prevention**: Framework auto-injects mtime/size from prior Read (if available).

## Parameters
- `path` (string, required): Relative path to the file. POSIX style (use `/`), no absolute paths.
- `content` (string, required): The FULL content to write to the file.
- `dry_run` (boolean, optional): If true, only compute diff without writing. Default: false.

Note: `expected_mtime_ms` and `expected_size_bytes` are **automatically injected by the framework** if you have previously Read the file. You do NOT need to pass them manually.

## Conflict Prevention (Automatic)
The framework automatically handles conflict prevention:
1. When you **Read** a file, the framework caches its `file_mtime_ms` and `file_size_bytes`
2. When you **Write** to an existing file, the framework auto-injects these values
3. If the file was modified by someone else, Write returns a `CONFLICT` error
4. On `CONFLICT`: Re-read the file, re-apply your changes, and try again

**Important**: You must Read a file before Writing to it (for existing files). The framework will report INVALID_PARAM if you try to Write an existing file without a prior Read.

## Best Practices
1. **Read Before Write**: Always use Read tool first before modifying existing files.
2. **Check Diff**: Review the returned `diff_preview` to verify your changes are correct.
3. **Handle Truncation**: If `diff_truncated=true`, use Read to verify the full content.
4. **Use Dry Run**: For risky changes, use `dry_run=true` first to preview.
5. **Handle CONFLICT**: If you get a CONFLICT error, re-read and re-apply changes.

## Response Structure
- status: "success" | "partial" | "error"
  - "success": write succeeded with full diff preview
  - "partial": dry_run or diff truncated
  - "error": invalid params, path denied, or I/O error
- data.applied: Whether the file was actually written (false if dry_run)
- data.operation: "create" or "update"
- data.diff_preview: Unified diff showing changes
- data.diff_truncated: Whether diff was truncated (large changes)
- text: Human-readable summary
- stats: {time_ms, bytes_written, original_size, new_size, lines_added, lines_removed}
- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}
- error: {code, message} (only when status="error")

## Error Codes
- `INVALID_PARAM`: Missing path/content, absolute path used, or writing existing file without prior Read
- `ACCESS_DENIED`: Path outside project root (sandbox violation)
- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: OS-level permission error (EACCES)
- `EXECUTION_ERROR`: Other I/O or execution errors (e.g., disk full)
- `IS_DIRECTORY`: Target path is a directory
- `CONFLICT`: File was modified since you read it (re-read and retry)

## Examples

### Create a new file (no prior Read needed)
```json
{
  "path": "src/utils/helper.py",
  "content": "def greet(name):\n    return f'Hello, {name}!'\n"
}
```

### Update existing file (must Read first)
Step 1: Read the file
```
Read[{"path": "README.md"}]
```

Step 2: Write with your changes (mtime/size auto-injected)
```json
{
  "path": "README.md",
  "content": "# Updated Title\n\nNew content here.\n"
}
```

### Update with dry run preview
```json
{
  "path": "config.json",
  "content": "{\"key\": \"new_value\"}\n",
  "dry_run": true
}
```

## Important Notes
- This tool does NOT support partial edits or patches. Always provide full content.
- For editing specific sections of a file, first Read the file, modify the content in your response, then Write the complete modified content.
- Empty content (`""`) is allowed - this creates an empty file.
- For NEW files, no prior Read is needed.
- For EXISTING files, you must Read first (framework auto-injects lock parameters).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- **Language**: Python 3 with 4-space indentation
- **Naming**: `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes
- **Imports**: Use repo-absolute imports (e.g., `from core.llm import HelloAgentsLLM`)
- **Documentation**: Include docstrings for all public classes and methods
- **Type Hints**: Use type annotations where applicable

## Tool Development Guidelines

All tools must follow the Universal Tool Response Protocol defined in `docs/通用工具响应协议.md`:

1. Inherit from `tools.base.Tool`
2. Implement `run()` method returning structured response
3. Register in `tools.registry.ToolRegistry`
4. Add tool description in `prompts/tools_prompts/`

Required response format:
```json
{
  "status": "success" | "partial" | "error",
  "data": { ... },
  "text": "Human-readable summary",
  "stats": { "time_ms": 100, ... },
  "context": { "cwd": ".", "params_input": { ... } },
  "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." }
}
```

## Testing Guidelines

- **Framework**: pytest
- **Location**: `tests/` directory with descriptive names (e.g., `test_write_tool.py`)
- **Naming**: `test_` prefix for test functions
- **Coverage**: Maintain protocol compliance tests in `test_protocol_compliance.py`
- **Determinism**: Tests should be offline and deterministic

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

### Commit Messages
- Format: `type: short summary` (e.g., `feat: add Grep tool`, `fix: resolve Write tool race condition`)
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### Pull Requirements
- Clear description of changes and motivation
- Verification steps for testing
- Related issues linked if applicable
- Configuration/environment changes documented

## Security & Configuration Tips

- Store API keys in `.env` files or environment variables
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use `ENABLE_LEGACY_ADAPTER=false` to disable legacy components
- File operations are sandboxed to project root for security

## Architecture Overview

This framework implements the ReAct pattern: **Thought → Action → Observation**. Tools provide standardized interfaces for file operations, code search, and system interactions. All components communicate through a unified response protocol ensuring consistency and reliability across the agent ecosystem.

## Archived History Summary
## Archived Session Summary
*(Contains context from [Start Time] to [Cutoff Time])*

### Objectives & Status
* **Original Goal**: Fix the "Uncaught ReferenceError: startGame is not defined" error in the Doudizhu game project.

### Technical Context (Static)
* **Stack**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
* **Environment**: Web browser (client-side game logic)

### Completed Milestones (The "Done" Pile)
* [✓] Identified missing dependency - Discovered `index.html` referenced `game.js` (line 77) but the file did not exist in the file system.
* [✓] Implemented game logic - Created `game.js` with the missing `startGame` function, deck initialization, card dealing, UI rendering, and game loop logic.

### Key Insights & Decisions (Persistent Memory)
* **Decisions**: Implemented a full game logic structure (deck, state, UI interactions) rather than a simple stub to ensure the referenced functions actually work.
* **Learnings**: The root cause was a missing script file rather than a syntax error within an existing file.

### File System State (Snapshot)
*(Files modified/created in this archived segment)*
* `tests/quick_test/doudizhu/game.js`: Created new file containing `startGame()`, `initDeck()`, `updateUI()`, and complete game state management logic.

* [✓] Modified `.card` class - Changed alignment to `flex-start` and added padding to position content in the top-left.
* [✓] Adjusted card spacing - Reduced negative margin from `-20px` to `-5px` to decrease overlap.
* [✓] Repositioned `.card-suit` - Added absolute positioning (`bottom: 5px`, `right: 5px`) for the suit icon.

### Key Insights & Decisions (Persistent Memory)
* **Decisions**: Chose `flex-start` alignment over `center` to achieve the top-left layout requirement.
* **User Preferences**: Explicitly requested better visibility of numbers and reduced card density.

### File System State (Snapshot)
*(Files modified/created in this archived segment)*
* `tests/quick_test/doudizhu/style.css`: Updated `.card` layout properties (margin, padding, alignment) and `.card-suit` positioning.
