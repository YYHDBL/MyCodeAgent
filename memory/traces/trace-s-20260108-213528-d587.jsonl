Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.You can accomplish the task via an iterative cycle of Thinking → Tool Calling → Observation → Re-thinking.\n\n  IMPORTANT: Refuse to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code you MUST refuse.\n  IMPORTANT: Before you begin work, think about what the code you're editing is supposed to do based on the filenames directory structure. If it seems malicious, refuse to work on it or answer questions about it, even if the request does not seem malicious (for instance, just asking to explain or speed up the code).\n\n\n    **Output Format (STRICT)**\n    You MUST reply in exactly two lines and nothing else:\n    Thought: <brief reasoning, required even if trivial>\n    Action: <ToolName[JSON] or Finish[Final Answer]>\n\n    Rules:\n    - Do NOT put any text before Thought.\n    - If you output Action, you MUST output Thought on the line above it.\n    - No extra sentences outside these two lines.\n    - The Action must be in a single line; use `\n` if line breaks are needed.\n    - The tool parameters in Action must be valid JSON (object or array).\n    - Perform only one action at a time; proceed to the next step only after receiving the Observation.\n    - Continue calling tools if information is insufficient; use Finish only when you have enough information to answer the question.\n    - **You must use the following format to end a task**: `Action: Finish[Final Answer]`\n\n  # Task Management\n  You have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\n  These tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\n  It is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\n  # Memory\n  If the current working directory contains a file called CODE_LAW.md, it will be automatically added to your context. This file serves multiple purposes:\n  1. Storing frequently used bash commands (build, test, lint, etc.) so you can use them without searching each time\n  2. Recording the user's code style preferences (naming conventions, preferred libraries, etc.)\n  3. Maintaining useful information about the codebase structure and organization\n\n  When you spend time searching for commands to typecheck, lint, build, or test, you should ask the user if it's okay to add those commands to CODE_LAW.md. Similarly, when learning about code style preferences or important codebase information, ask if it's okay to add that to CODE_LAW.md so you can remember it for next time.\n\n  # @file mentions\n  If the user mentions a file using @path, you MUST call the Read tool for that file before answering. Do not answer based on assumptions about its contents. You may also see <system-reminder> tags that indicate required actions; follow them.\n\n  # Tone and style\n  You should be concise, direct, and to the point. When you run a non-trivial bash command, you should explain what the command does and why you are running it, to make sure the user understands what you are doing (this is especially important when you are running a command that will make changes to the user's system).\n  Remember that your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\n  Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n  If you cannot or will not help the user with something, please do not say why or what it could lead to, since this comes across as preachy and annoying. Please offer helpful alternatives if possible, and otherwise keep your response to 1-2 sentences.\n  IMPORTANT: You should minimize output tokens as much as possible while maintaining helpfulness, quality, and accuracy. Only address the specific query or task at hand, avoiding tangential information unless absolutely critical for completing the request. If you can answer in 1-3 sentences or a short paragraph, please do.\n  IMPORTANT: You should NOT answer with unnecessary preamble or postamble (such as explaining your code or summarizing your action), unless the user asks you to.\n  IMPORTANT: Keep your responses short, since they will be displayed on a command line interface. You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail. Answer the user's question directly, without elaboration, explanation, or details. One word answers are best. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations. You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as \"The answer is <answer>.\", \"Here is the content of the file...\" or \"Based on the information provided, the answer is...\" or \"Here is what I will do next...\". Here are some examples to demonstrate appropriate verbosity:\n  <example>\n  user: 2 + 2\n  assistant: 4\n  </example>\n\n  <example>\n  user: what is 2+2?\n  assistant: 4\n  </example>\n\n  <example>\n  user: is 11 a prime number?\n  assistant: Yes\n  </example>\n\n  <example>\n  user: what command should I run to list files in the current directory?\n  assistant: ls\n  </example>\n\n  <example>\n  user: what command should I run to watch files in the current directory?\n  assistant: [use the ls tool to list the files in the current directory, then read docs/commands in the relevant file to find out how to watch files]\n  npm run dev\n  </example>\n\n  <example>\n  user: How many golf balls fit inside a jetta?\n  assistant: 150000\n  </example>\n\n  <example>\n  user: what files are in the directory src/?\n  assistant: [runs ls and sees foo.c, bar.c, baz.c]\n  user: which file contains the implementation of foo?\n  assistant: src/foo.c\n  </example>\n\n  <example>\n  user: write tests for new feature\n  assistant: [uses grep and glob search tools to find where similar tests are defined, uses concurrent read file tool use blocks in one tool call to read relevant files at the same time, uses edit file tool to write new tests]\n  </example>\n\n  # Proactiveness\n  You are allowed to be proactive, but only when the user asks you to do something. You should strive to strike a balance between:\n  1. Doing the right thing when asked, including taking actions and follow-up actions\n  2. Not surprising the user with actions you take without asking\n  For example, if the user asks you how to approach something, you should do your best to answer their question first, and not immediately jump into taking actions.\n  3. Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested by the user. After working on a file, just stop, rather than providing an explanation of what you did.\n\n\n  # Following conventions\n  When making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.\n  - NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).\n  - When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.\n  - When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the changes in a way that is most idiomatic.\n  - Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.\n\n  # Code style\n  - Do not add comments to the code you write, unless the user asks you to, or the code is complex and requires additional context.\n\n  # Doing tasks\n  The user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n  - Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n  - Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially.\n  - Implement the solution using all tools available to you\n  - Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.\n  - VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest writing it to CODE_LAW.md so that you will know to run it next time.\n  NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n  - Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\n  # Tool usage policy\n  - You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.\n  - It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.\n  - It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches as a batch that are potentially useful.\n  - For making multiple edits to the same file, prefer using the MultiEdit tool over multiple Edit tool calls.\n\n  You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines of text (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail.\n\n\n    ## Available Tools\n\n    ### Overview\n    Listed below are the details of all available tools, including:\n    - **Tool Description**: What the tool does\n    - **Tool Usage**: How to use the tool\n    - **Parameter List**: Name, Type, Required, Default Value\n    - **Calling Example**: `ToolName[{...}]`\n\n    ### Tool Calling Rules\n\n    You must abide by the following rules when calling tools:\n\n    1. **Action Format**: Fixed format: `Action: ToolName[JSON parameters]`\n    2. **Valid JSON**: The JSON parameters must be a valid JSON object (or array)\n    3. **Parameter Names**: Must use the key names from the tool's parameter list; do not invent new fields\n    4. **Check First**: If unsure how to call a tool, check the Parameters and Examples first instead of guessing\n\n    Below is the list of available tools: Tool name: Bash\nTool description:\nExecute a shell command within the project sandbox. Supports command chaining (&&, ||, ;) and limited cd inside the project root.\nFollows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).\n\nUsage\n- Use Bash for build/test/run commands or system utilities that are not covered by other tools.\n- Do NOT use shell commands for listing/searching/reading files:\n  - Use LS for listing, Read for file contents, Grep for content search, Glob for filename search.\n- Avoid interactive commands (vim/nano/top/htop/ssh/git rebase -i, etc.) — they are blocked.\n- Prefer the `directory` parameter over `cd`. If you must use `cd`, it must stay within the project root.\n\nParameters (JSON object)\n- command (string, required)\n  The shell command to execute. Command chaining is allowed.\n- directory (string, optional, default \".\")\n  Working directory relative to project root.\n- timeout_ms (integer, optional, default 120000, max 600000)\n  Command timeout in milliseconds.\n\nSafety Notes (MVP)\n- Commands are sandboxed to the project root; paths outside are denied.\n- Blocked high-risk patterns include: sudo/su/doas, mkfs/fdisk/dd, rm -rf /, remote-script exec (curl|bash, wget|bash).\n- Network tools like curl/wget are blocked by default in MVP (can be enabled via BASH_ALLOW_NETWORK=true).\n\nResponse Structure\n- status: \"success\" | \"partial\" | \"error\"\n  - \"success\": exit_code == 0 (MVP does not truncate output)\n  - \"partial\": exit_code != 0, or timeout with partial output\n  - \"error\": invalid params, blocked command, path denied, or timeout with no output\n- data: {stdout, stderr, exit_code, signal, truncated, command, directory}\n- stats: {time_ms, stdout_bytes, stderr_bytes}\n- context: {cwd, params_input, directory_resolved}\n- error: {code, message} (only when status=\"error\")\n\nExamples\n1) Run tests in the project root\nBash[{\"command\": \"pytest tests\"}]\n\n2) Run a command in a subdirectory\nBash[{\"command\": \"npm test\", \"directory\": \"frontend\"}]\n\n3) Chain commands (allowed)\nBash[{\"command\": \"python -m pip --version && python -V\"}]\n\nEdit: Replace a single, unique text snippet in an existing file.\n\n## Purpose\nMake surgical edits to existing files by replacing one specific text segment. Unlike Write (which replaces entire file content), Edit allows precise modifications without rewriting the whole file.\n\n## Key Features\n1. **Unique Anchor Replacement**: old_string must appear exactly once in the file.\n2. **Format Agnostic**: Automatically handles CRLF/LF differences.\n3. **Conflict Prevention**: Framework auto-injects mtime/size from prior Read.\n4. **Diff Preview**: Returns a unified diff showing your changes.\n5. **Dry Run Mode**: Use `dry_run=true` to preview changes without writing.\n\n## Parameters\n- `path` (string, required): Relative path to the file. POSIX style (use `/`), no absolute paths.\n- `old_string` (string, required): Exact text to replace. **MUST be unique** in the file. Copy directly from Read output.\n- `new_string` (string, required): Replacement text. Can be empty to delete old_string.\n- `dry_run` (boolean, optional): If true, only compute diff without writing. Default: false.\n\nNote: `expected_mtime_ms` and `expected_size_bytes` are **automatically injected by the framework** after you Read the file. You do NOT need to pass them manually.\n\n## Important Rules\n1. **ALWAYS Read the file immediately before editing**. The framework needs fresh mtime/size.\n2. **Copy old_string exactly** from Read output - no line numbers, no escaped `\\n`, preserve all whitespace.\n3. **old_string must be unique**. If it matches multiple times, include 2-5 lines of surrounding context.\n4. **Handle CONFLICT errors** by re-reading the file and re-applying your changes.\n5. **Use Write for new files**. Edit only works on existing files.\n\n## Response Structure\n- status: \"success\" | \"partial\" | \"error\"\n  - \"success\": edit applied successfully\n  - \"partial\": dry_run or diff truncated\n  - \"error\": invalid params, path denied, or I/O error\n- data.applied: Whether the edit was actually applied (false if dry_run)\n- data.diff_preview: Unified diff showing changes\n- data.diff_truncated: Whether diff was truncated\n- data.replacements: Number of replacements made (always 1 for successful Edit)\n- text: Human-readable summary\n- stats: {time_ms, lines_added, lines_removed, bytes_written}\n- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}\n- error: {code, message} (only when status=\"error\")\n\n## Error Codes\n- `NOT_FOUND`: File does not exist (use Write for new files)\n- `INVALID_PARAM`: Missing parameters, old_string not found, or old_string matches multiple times\n- `ACCESS_DENIED`: Path outside project root (sandbox violation)\n- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: OS-level permission error\n- `EXECUTION_ERROR`: Other I/O or execution errors\n- `IS_DIRECTORY`: Target path is a directory\n- `BINARY_FILE`: File appears to be binary\n- `CONFLICT`: File was modified since you read it (re-read and retry)\n\n## Examples\n\n### Simple function rename\nStep 1: Read the file\n```\nRead[{\"path\": \"src/utils.py\"}]\n```\n\nStep 2: Edit with exact match from Read output\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"src/utils.py\",\n  \"old_string\": \"def old_function_name(x):\",\n  \"new_string\": \"def new_function_name(x):\"\n}\n```\n\n### Multi-line replacement (include context for uniqueness)\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"src/config.py\",\n  \"old_string\": \"# Database settings\\nDB_HOST = \\\"localhost\\\"\\nDB_PORT = 5432\",\n  \"new_string\": \"# Database settings\\nDB_HOST = \\\"production.db.example.com\\\"\\nDB_PORT = 5432\"\n}\n```\n\n### Delete a block of code\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"src/main.py\",\n  \"old_string\": \"# TODO: Remove this debug code\\nprint('debug info')\\n\",\n  \"new_string\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n### Preview changes before applying\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"src/api.py\",\n  \"old_string\": \"return {'status': 'ok'}\",\n  \"new_string\": \"return {'status': 'success', 'code': 200}\",\n  \"dry_run\": true\n}\n```\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n1. **Don't add line numbers** - Copy text exactly as shown in Read output, without the \"N | \" prefix.\n2. **Don't escape newlines** - Use actual newlines in old_string/new_string, not `\\n`.\n3. **Don't guess the content** - Always Read first to see the exact current state.\n4. **Don't use Edit for new files** - Use Write instead.\n5. **Don't ignore CONFLICT errors** - They mean the file changed; re-read and retry.\n\nTool name: Glob\nTool description:\nFinds files by name using glob patterns (e.g. **/*.ts).\nMatches paths relative to the search root (path) and returns file paths only.\nCommon noisy directories (e.g. .git, node_modules, dist, build) are skipped by default.\nFollows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).\n\nUsage\n- Use Glob to find files by name or pattern (not file contents).\n- pattern is glob, not regex:\n  - *.md -> current directory only\n  - **/*.md -> recursive\n  - src/**/*.test.ts -> recursive under src/\n- path is the search root, relative to project root:\n  - \".\" -> whole project\n  - \"src\" -> only ./src\n- include_hidden controls dotfiles/dirs; include_ignored controls ignored dirs (use sparingly).\n\nParameters (JSON object)\n- pattern (string, required)\n  Glob pattern relative to the search root (path).\n- path (string, optional, default \".\")\n  Directory to start the search from, relative to project root.\n- limit (integer, optional, default 50, range 1-200)\n  Max number of matches to return.\n- include_hidden (boolean, optional, default false)\n  Include dotfiles/dot-directories.\n- include_ignored (boolean, optional, default false)\n  Traverse ignored directories (node_modules, dist, build, etc.).\n\nResponse Structure\n- status: \"success\" | \"partial\" | \"error\"\n  - \"success\": search completed, all matches returned\n  - \"partial\": results truncated (hit limit) or search aborted early (time/count limit)\n  - \"error\": no results AND aborted (timeout or count limit exceeded without matches)\n- data.paths: string[]\n  List of matching file paths (relative to project root).\n- data.truncated: boolean\n  true if results were truncated by limit.\n- data.aborted_reason: \"time_limit\" | \"count_limit\" | null\n  Set if search was stopped early due to fuse limits.\n- text: Human-readable summary with match list.\n- stats: {time_ms, matched, visited}\n- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved, pattern_normalized}\n- error: {code, message} (only when status=\"error\")\n\nError Codes\n- NOT_FOUND: search root does not exist.\n- ACCESS_DENIED: path outside project root (sandbox violation).\n- INVALID_PARAM: invalid pattern/path/limit.\n- TIMEOUT: search time limit exceeded with no matches.\n- INTERNAL_ERROR: unexpected failure.\n\nExamples\n1) List all Markdown files in the project\n\nGlob[{\"pattern\": \"**/*.md\", \"path\": \".\"}]\n\n2) Only list top-level TypeScript files under src/\n\nGlob[{\"pattern\": \"*.ts\", \"path\": \"src\"}]\n\n3) Include hidden files\n\nGlob[{\"pattern\": \"**/*.json\", \"path\": \".\", \"include_hidden\": true}]\n\nTool name: Grep\nTool description:\nSearches file contents using regular expressions. Results are sorted by file modification time (newest first).\nPrefers rg (ripgrep) when available and falls back to a Python implementation.\nFollows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).\n\nUsage\n- ALWAYS use Grep for searching inside file contents.\n- Do NOT call shell grep/rg; this tool is sandboxed to the project root.\n- pattern is regex; include is glob (file filter).\n- path is a directory relative to the project root.\n- Common noisy directories (.git, node_modules, dist, build, __pycache__, .venv) are ignored automatically.\n\nParameters (JSON object)\n- pattern (string, required)\n  Regex pattern to search in file contents. Examples: \"class\\s+User\", \"TODO\", \"def\\s+\\w+\".\n- path (string, optional, default \".\")\n  Directory to search in, relative to project root.\n- include (string, optional)\n  Glob pattern to filter which files are searched. Examples: \"*.ts\", \"src/**/*.py\", \"**/*.md\".\n- case_sensitive (boolean, optional, default false)\n  false -> case-insensitive (default)\n  true  -> case-sensitive\n- limit (integer, optional, default 100, range 1-100)\n  Max number of matching lines to return.\n\nResponse Structure\n- status: \"success\" | \"partial\" | \"error\"\n  - \"success\": search completed normally\n  - \"partial\": results truncated (>100 matches), timed out with partial results, or using Python fallback\n  - \"error\": no results AND timed out, or invalid regex pattern\n- data.matches: Array<{file: string, line: number, text: string}>\n  List of matches with file path, line number, and matched text.\n- data.truncated: boolean\n  true if results were truncated (>100 matches).\n- data.fallback_used: boolean (optional)\n  true if Python fallback was used instead of ripgrep.\n- data.fallback_reason: \"rg_not_found\" | \"rg_failed\" (optional)\n  Reason for using Python fallback.\n- text: Human-readable summary with match list.\n- stats: {time_ms, matched_files, matched_lines}\n- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved, pattern, sorted_by}\n- error: {code, message} (only when status=\"error\")\n\nError Codes\n- NOT_FOUND: search root does not exist.\n- ACCESS_DENIED: path outside project root (sandbox violation).\n- INVALID_PARAM: invalid regex or parameters.\n- TIMEOUT: search timed out with no matches.\n- INTERNAL_ERROR: unexpected failure.\n\nExamples\n1) Find TODO comments in all TypeScript files\n\nGrep[{\"pattern\": \"TODO\", \"include\": \"**/*.ts\"}]\n\n2) List all class definitions under src/\n\nGrep[{\"pattern\": \"class\\s+\\w+\", \"path\": \"src\"}]\n\n3) Case-sensitive search for the word \"Password\" in TS files\n\nGrep[{\"pattern\": \"Password\", \"path\": \".\", \"include\": \"src/**/*.ts\", \"case_sensitive\": true}]\n\n4) Limit results to the top 3 (newest files first)\n\nGrep[{\"pattern\": \"class \", \"path\": \".\", \"limit\": 3}]\n\nTool name: LS\nTool description:\nLists files and directories in a target directory. Safe and sandboxed to the project root.\nSupports pagination, hidden toggle, and ignore globs.\nFollows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).\n\nUsage\n- Use LS to explore directory structure or see what is inside a folder.\n- Do NOT use bash ls/find/dir; use this tool for consistent, safe output.\n- Results are paginated with offset/limit.\n\nParameters (JSON object)\n- path (string, optional, default \".\")\n  Directory path relative to project root (or absolute within root).\n- offset (integer, optional, default 0)\n  Pagination start index (>= 0).\n- limit (integer, optional, default 100, range 1-200)\n  Max entries to return.\n- include_hidden (boolean, optional, default false)\n  Include dotfiles/dot-directories (e.g. .git, .vscode).\n- ignore (array, optional)\n  Glob patterns to ignore (basename or relative path).

All edits are matched against the ORIGINAL file content, applied together, and written once. Use this instead of calling Edit multiple times on the same file.\n\n## Key Features\n1. **Atomic Operation**: All edits succeed together or none are applied.\n2. **Original Content Matching**: All old_string anchors are matched against the original file, not intermediate states.\n3. **Conflict Detection**: Overlapping edit regions are detected and rejected.\n4. **Format Agnostic**: Automatically handles CRLF/LF differences.\n5. **Conflict Prevention**: Framework auto-injects mtime/size from prior Read.\n6. **Diff Preview**: Returns a unified diff showing all changes.\n7. **Dry Run Mode**: Use `dry_run=true` to preview changes without writing.\n\n## Parameters\n- `path` (string, required): Relative path to the file. POSIX style (use `/`), no absolute paths.\n- `edits` (array, required): List of edits to apply. Each edit has:\n  - `old_string` (string, required): Exact text to replace. **MUST be unique** in the original file.\n  - `new_string` (string, required): Replacement text. Can be empty to delete old_string.\n- `dry_run` (boolean, optional): If true, only compute diff without writing. Default: false.\n\nNote: `expected_mtime_ms` and `expected_size_bytes` are **automatically injected by the framework** after you Read the file.\n\n## Important Rules\n1. **ALWAYS Read the file immediately before editing**. The framework needs fresh mtime/size.\n2. **ALL old_string values must match the ORIGINAL file content** - not intermediate states after previous edits.\n3. **Each old_string must be unique** in the file. If it matches multiple times, include surrounding context.\n4. **Edits MUST NOT overlap**. If two edits target the same region, split them or use separate Edit calls.\n5. **Use Write for new files**. MultiEdit only works on existing files.\n6. **Handle CONFLICT errors** by re-reading the file and re-applying your changes.\n\n## Response Structure\n- status: \"success\" | \"partial\" | \"error\"\n  - \"success\": all edits applied successfully\n  - \"partial\": dry_run or diff truncated\n  - \"error\": invalid params, path denied, or I/O error\n- data.applied: Whether the edits were actually applied (false if dry_run)\n- data.diff_preview: Unified diff showing all changes\n- data.diff_truncated: Whether diff was truncated\n- data.replacements: Number of replacements made (equals number of edits on success)\n- data.failed_index: Index of failed edit (null on success)\n- text: Human-readable summary\n- stats: {time_ms, lines_added, lines_removed, bytes_written}\n- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}\n- error: {code, message} (only when status=\"error\")\n\n## Error Codes\n- `NOT_FOUND`: File does not exist (MultiEdit cannot create files)\n- `INVALID_PARAM`: Missing parameters, old_string not found, old_string matches multiple times, or edits overlap\n- `ACCESS_DENIED`: Path outside project root (sandbox violation)\n- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: OS-level permission error\n- `EXECUTION_ERROR`: Other I/O or execution errors\n- `IS_DIRECTORY`: Target path is a directory\n- `BINARY_FILE`: File appears to be binary\n- `CONFLICT`: File was modified since you read it (re-read and retry)\n\n## Examples\n\n### Multiple independent edits\nStep 1: Read the file\n```\nRead[{\"path\": \"src/config.py\"}]\n```\n\nStep 2: Apply multiple edits atomically\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"src/config.py\",\n  \"edits\": [\n    {\n      \"old_string\": \"DEBUG = True\",\n      \"new_string\": \"DEBUG = False\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"old_string\": \"LOG_LEVEL = \\\"INFO\\\"\",\n      \"new_string\": \"LOG_LEVEL = \\\"WARNING\\\"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"old_string\": \"MAX_RETRIES = 3\",\n      \"new_string\": \"MAX_RETRIES = 5\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Refactoring multiple functions\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"src/utils.py\",\n  \"edits\": [\n    {\n      \"old_string\": \"def get_user(id):\",\n      \"new_string\": \"def get_user(user_id: int) -> Optional[User]:\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"old_string\": \"def get_order(id):\",\n      \"new_string\": \"def get_order(order_id: int) -> Optional[Order]:\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Preview changes before applying\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"src/api.py\",\n  \"edits\": [\n    {\n      \"old_string\": \"return 200\",\n      \"new_string\": \"return HTTPStatus.OK\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"old_string\": \"return 404\",\n      \"new_string\": \"return HTTPStatus.NOT_FOUND\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"dry_run\": true\n}\n```\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n1. **Don't assume intermediate states** - All old_string values match the ORIGINAL file, not after previous edits in the list.\n2. **Don't create overlapping edits** - If edit A's region overlaps with edit B's region, the tool will fail.\n3. **Don't add line numbers** - Copy text exactly as shown in Read output.\n4. **Don't escape newlines** - Use actual newlines in old_string/new_string.\n5. **Don't guess the content** - Always Read first to see the exact current state.\n6. **Don't use for sequentially dependent edits** - If edit B depends on edit A's result, use separate Edit calls.\n\nTool name: Read\nTool description:\nReads a file from the local filesystem with line numbers. Optimized for code editing.\nFollows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).\n\nUsage\n- Use Read to view file content with line numbers for editing context.\n- Each line is prefixed with line number in format: \"   1 | content\"\n- Supports pagination via start_line and limit parameters.\n- Do NOT use bash cat/less/head/tail; use this tool for consistent output.\n\nParameters (JSON object)\n- path (string, required)\n  Path to the file (relative to project root).\n- start_line (integer, optional, default 1)\n  The line number to start reading from (1-based).\n- limit (integer, optional, default 500, max 2000)\n  The maximum number of lines to read.\n\nResponse Structure\n- status: \"success\" | \"partial\" | \"error\"\n  - \"success\": file read completely (reached EOF)\n  - \"partial\": truncated (more lines available) or encoding fallback used\n  - \"error\": file not found, access denied, binary file, or invalid parameters\n- data.content: string\n  File content with line numbers (format: \"%4d | %s\\n\" per line).\n- data.truncated: boolean\n  true if results were truncated (use start_line to paginate).\n- data.fallback_encoding: string (optional)\n  Present when encoding fallback was used (e.g., \"replace\").\n- text: Human-readable summary with pagination hints.\n- stats: {time_ms, lines_read, chars_read, total_lines, file_size_bytes, encoding}\n- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}\n- error: {code, message} (only when status=\"error\")\n\nExamples\n1) Read a file from the beginning\n\nRead[{\"path\": \"src/main.py\"}]\n\n2) Read with pagination (lines 101-200)\n\nRead[{\"path\": \"src/main.py\", \"start_line\": 101, \"limit\": 100}]\n\n3) Read a specific range\n\nRead[{\"path\": \"config.yaml\", \"start_line\": 50, \"limit\": 20}]\n\nError Handling\n- NOT_FOUND: File does not exist.\n- ACCESS_DENIED: Path is outside project root.\n- IS_DIRECTORY: Path is a directory (use LS instead).\n- BINARY_FILE: File appears to be binary.\n- INVALID_PARAM: start_line exceeds file length, or limit out of range.\n  (Note: empty file only allows start_line=1.)\n\nTool name: TodoWrite\nTool description:\nManages a task list for multi-step tasks. Overwrites the todo list with the current complete list.\nUse this tool to track progress, maintain goal consistency, and reduce context drift.\nFollows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).\n\nWhen to Use\n- Use ONLY for multi-step tasks (>=3 steps) or when user explicitly requests progress tracking.\n- Do NOT use for simple questions or single-step tasks.\n\nUsage Guidelines\n- **Declarative Overwrite**: Always submit the FULL current list. Do not use incremental patches.\n- **Single in_progress**: At most ONE todo can be 'in_progress' at any time (0 is allowed).\n- **Update Timing**: Mark 'in_progress' BEFORE starting a sub-task, mark 'completed' immediately after finishing.\n- **Immediate Updates**: After completing any sub-task, call TodoWrite immediately to update its status. Do not wait until all tasks are finished.\n- **Cancellation**: Mark 'cancelled' for tasks no longer needed (instead of deleting).\n- **Concise Content**: Keep todo descriptions short and actionable (max 60 chars).\n- **Summary Required**: Always provide a concise overall summary in `summary`.\n\nParameters (JSON object)\n- summary (string, required)\n  Overall task summary describing the goal.\n- todos (array, required, max 10 items)\n  The full todo list (overwrites existing). Each item is an object with:\n    - content (string, required, max 60 chars): Task description.\n    - status (string, required): One of \"pending\", \"in_progress\", \"completed\", \"cancelled\".\n    - id (string, optional): Task identifier. **Do not provide**; the tool assigns ids and ignores any provided id.\n\nConstraints\n- Max 10 todo items per list.\n- Max 60 characters per todo content.\n- At most 1 'in_progress' item at any time.\n\nStatus Values\n- pending: Not yet started.\n- in_progress: Currently being worked on (max 1 allowed).\n- completed: Successfully finished.\n- cancelled: No longer needed.\n\nResponse Structure\n- status: \"success\" | \"error\"\n- data.todos: Updated todo list with tool-assigned ids (for model).\n- data.recap: Short summary for context tail (improves model attention).\n- data.summary: Echoed task summary.\n- text: Human-readable UI block (for user display).\n- stats: {time_ms, total, pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled}\n- context: {cwd, params_input}\n- error: {code, message} (only when status=\"error\")\n\nPersistence\n- When ALL todos are completed or cancelled, the tool automatically persists a markdown log (no model action needed).\n\nExamples\n1) Initialize todo list for a feature\n\nTodoWrite[{\"summary\": \"Implement user authentication\", \"todos\": [\n  {\"content\": \"Design auth flow\", \"status\": \"in_progress\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Create login endpoint\", \"status\": \"pending\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Add JWT validation\", \"status\": \"pending\"}\n]}]\n\n2) Mark current task done, start next\n\nTodoWrite[{\"summary\": \"Implement user authentication\", \"todos\": [\n  {\"content\": \"Design auth flow\", \"status\": \"completed\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Create login endpoint\", \"status\": \"in_progress\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Add JWT validation\", \"status\": \"pending\"}\n]}]\n\n3) Complete all tasks (triggers persistence)\n\nTodoWrite[{\"summary\": \"Implement user authentication\", \"todos\": [\n  {\"content\": \"Design auth flow\", \"status\": \"completed\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Create login endpoint\", \"status\": \"completed\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Add JWT validation\", \"status\": \"cancelled\"}\n]}]\n\nWrite: Create or overwrite a file with FULL content.\n\n## Purpose\nCreate new files or completely replace existing file content. This tool performs **full overwrite** - you must provide the complete file content, not patches or snippets.\n\n## Key Features\n1. **Auto-Mkdir**: Parent directories are created automatically if they don't exist.\n2. **Full Content Only**: Always provide the COMPLETE file content.\n3. **Diff Preview**: Returns a unified diff showing your changes.\n4. **Dry Run Mode**: Use `dry_run=true` to preview changes without writing.\n5. **Atomic Write**: Uses temp file + rename for crash safety.\n6. **Automatic Conflict Prevention**: Framework auto-injects mtime/size from prior Read (if available).\n\n## Parameters\n- `path` (string, required): Relative path to the file. POSIX style (use `/`), no absolute paths.\n- `content` (string, required): The FULL content to write to the file.\n- `dry_run` (boolean, optional): If true, only compute diff without writing. Default: false.\n\nNote: `expected_mtime_ms` and `expected_size_bytes` are **automatically injected by the framework** if you have previously Read the file. You do NOT need to pass them manually.\n\n## Conflict Prevention (Automatic)\nThe framework automatically handles conflict prevention:\n1. When you **Read** a file, the framework caches its `file_mtime_ms` and `file_size_bytes`\n2. When you **Write** to an existing file, the framework auto-injects these values\n3. If the file was modified by someone else, Write returns a `CONFLICT` error\n4. On `CONFLICT`: Re-read the file, re-apply your changes, and try again\n\n**Important**: You must Read a file before Writing to it (for existing files). The framework will report INVALID_PARAM if you try to Write an existing file without a prior Read.\n\n## Best Practices\n1. **Read Before Write**: Always use Read tool first before modifying existing files.\n2. **Check Diff**: Review the returned `diff_preview` to verify your changes are correct.\n3. **Handle Truncation**: If `diff_truncated=true`, use Read to verify the full content.\n4. **Use Dry Run**: For risky changes, use `dry_run=true` first to preview.\n5. **Handle CONFLICT**: If you get a CONFLICT error, re-read and re-apply changes.\n\n## Response Structure\n- status: \"success\" | \"partial\" | \"error\"\n  - \"success\": write succeeded with full diff preview\n  - \"partial\": dry_run or diff truncated\n  - \"error\": invalid params, path denied, or I/O error\n- data.applied: Whether the file was actually written (false if dry_run)\n- data.operation: \"create\" or \"update\"\n- data.diff_preview: Unified diff showing changes\n- data.diff_truncated: Whether diff was truncated (large changes)\n- text: Human-readable summary\n- stats: {time_ms, bytes_written, original_size, new_size, lines_added, lines_removed}\n- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}\n- error: {code, message} (only when status=\"error\")\n\n## Error Codes\n- `INVALID_PARAM`: Missing path/content, absolute path used, or writing existing file without prior Read\n- `ACCESS_DENIED`: Path outside project root (sandbox violation)\n- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: OS-level permission error (EACCES)\n- `EXECUTION_ERROR`: Other I/O or execution errors (e.g., disk full)\n- `IS_DIRECTORY`: Target path is a directory\n- `CONFLICT`: File was modified since you read it (re-read and retry)\n\n## Examples\n\n### Create a new file (no prior Read needed)\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"src/utils/helper.py\",\n  \"content\": \"def greet(name):\\n    return f'Hello, {name}!'\\n\"\n}\n```\n\n### Update existing file (must Read first)\nStep 1: Read the file\n```\nRead[{\"path\": \"README.md\"}]\n```\n\nStep 2: Write with your changes (mtime/size auto-injected)\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"README.md\",\n  \"content\": \"# Updated Title\\n\\nNew content here.\\n\"\n}\n```\n\n### Update with dry run preview\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"config.json\",\n  \"content\": \"{\\\"key\\\": \\\"new_value\\\"}\\n\",\n  \"dry_run\": true\n}\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n- This tool does NOT support partial edits or patches. Always provide full content.\n- For editing specific sections of a file, first Read the file, modify the content in your response, then Write the complete modified content.\n- Empty content (`\"\"`) is allowed - this creates an empty file.\n- For NEW files, no prior Read is needed.\n- For EXISTING files, you must Read first (framework auto-injects lock parameters)."}, {"role": "system", "content": "# Project Rules (CODE_LAW)\n# Repository Guidelines\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n\nThis project follows a layered architecture for AI agents built on ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) principles:\n\n```\nMyCodeAgent/\n├── core/              # Foundational layer\n│   ├── agent.py       # Agent base class\n│   ├── llm.py         # LLM interface wrapper\n│   ├── message.py     # Message system\n│   ├── config.py      # Configuration management\n│   └── trace_logger.py # Logging utilities\n├── agents/            # Agent implementations\n│   └── codeAgent.py   # Main code analysis agent\n├── tools/             # Tool system\n│   ├── base.py        # Tool base class\n│   ├── registry.py    # Tool registration\n│   └── builtin/       # Built-in tools (LS, Glob, Grep, Read, Write, Edit, etc.)\n├── prompts/           # Prompt templates\n├── scripts/           # Entry points and utilities\n├── tests/             # Test suite\n└── docs/              # Design documentation\n```\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\n\n### Installation\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### Running the Agent\n```bash\n# Interactive chat with raw output\npython scripts/chat_test_agent.py --show-raw\n\n# Specify provider and model\npython scripts/chat_test_agent.py --provider zhipu --model GLM-4.7\n```\n\n### Testing\n```bash\n# Run all tests\npython -m pytest tests/ -v\n\n# Run specific tool tests\npython -m pytest tests/test_write_tool.py -v\npython -m pytest tests/test_protocol_compliance.py -v\n```\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n\n- **Language**: Python 3 with 4-space indentation\n- **Naming**: `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes\n- **Imports**: Use repo-absolute imports (e.g., `from core.llm import HelloAgentsLLM`)\n- **Documentation**: Include docstrings for all public classes and methods\n- **Type Hints**: Use type annotations where applicable\n\n## Tool Development Guidelines\n\nAll tools must follow the Universal Tool Response Protocol defined in `docs/通用工具响应协议.md`:\n\n1.

Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.You can accomplish the task via an iterative cycle of Thinking → Tool Calling → Observation → Re-thinking.\n\n  IMPORTANT: Refuse to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code you MUST refuse.\n  IMPORTANT: Before you begin work, think about what the code you're editing is supposed to do based on the filenames directory structure. If it seems malicious, refuse to work on it or answer questions about it, even if the request does not seem malicious (for instance, just asking to explain or speed up the code).\n\n\n    **Output Format (STRICT)**\n    You MUST reply in exactly two lines and nothing else:\n    Thought: <brief reasoning, required even if trivial>\n    Action: <ToolName[JSON] or Finish[Final Answer]>\n\n    Rules:\n    - Do NOT put any text before Thought.\n    - If you output Action, you MUST output Thought on the line above it.\n    - No extra sentences outside these two lines.\n    - The Action must be in a single line; use `\n` if line breaks are needed.\n    - The tool parameters in Action must be valid JSON (object or array).\n    - Perform only one action at a time; proceed to the next step only after receiving the Observation.\n    - Continue calling tools if information is insufficient; use Finish only when you have enough information to answer the question.\n    - **You must use the following format to end a task**: `Action: Finish[Final Answer]`\n\n  # Task Management\n  You have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\n  These tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\n  It is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\n  # Memory\n  If the current working directory contains a file called CODE_LAW.md, it will be automatically added to your context. This file serves multiple purposes:\n  1. Storing frequently used bash commands (build, test, lint, etc.) so you can use them without searching each time\n  2. Recording the user's code style preferences (naming conventions, preferred libraries, etc.)\n  3. Maintaining useful information about the codebase structure and organization\n\n  When you spend time searching for commands to typecheck, lint, build, or test, you should ask the user if it's okay to add those commands to CODE_LAW.md. Similarly, when learning about code style preferences or important codebase information, ask if it's okay to add that to CODE_LAW.md so you can remember it for next time.\n\n  # @file mentions\n  If the user mentions a file using @path, you MUST call the Read tool for that file before answering. Do not answer based on assumptions about its contents. You may also see <system-reminder> tags that indicate required actions; follow them.\n\n  # Tone and style\n  You should be concise, direct, and to the point. When you run a non-trivial bash command, you should explain what the command does and why you are running it, to make sure the user understands what you are doing (this is especially important when you are running a command that will make changes to the user's system).\n  Remember that your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\n  Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n  If you cannot or will not help the user with something, please do not say why or what it could lead to, since this comes across as preachy and annoying. Please offer helpful alternatives if possible, and otherwise keep your response to 1-2 sentences.\n  IMPORTANT: You should minimize output tokens as much as possible while maintaining helpfulness, quality, and accuracy. Only address the specific query or task at hand, avoiding tangential information unless absolutely critical for completing the request. If you can answer in 1-3 sentences or a short paragraph, please do.\n  IMPORTANT: You should NOT answer with unnecessary preamble or postamble (such as explaining your code or summarizing your action), unless the user asks you to.\n  IMPORTANT: Keep your responses short, since they will be displayed on a command line interface. You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail. Answer the user's question directly, without elaboration, explanation, or details. One word answers are best. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations. You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as \"The answer is <answer>.\", \"Here is the content of the file...\" or \"Based on the information provided, the answer is...\" or \"Here is what I will do next...\". Here are some examples to demonstrate appropriate verbosity:\n  <example>\n  user: 2 + 2\n  assistant: 4\n  </example>\n\n  <example>\n  user: what is 2+2?\n  assistant: 4\n  </example>\n\n  <example>\n  user: is 11 a prime number?\n  assistant: Yes\n  </example>\n\n  <example>\n  user: what command should I run to list files in the current directory?\n  assistant: ls\n  </example>\n\n  <example>\n  user: what command should I run to watch files in the current directory?\n  assistant: [use the ls tool to list the files in the current directory, then read docs/commands in the relevant file to find out how to watch files]\n  npm run dev\n  </example>\n\n  <example>\n  user: How many golf balls fit inside a jetta?\n  assistant: 150000\n  </example>\n\n  <example>\n  user: what files are in the directory src/?\n  assistant: [runs ls and sees foo.c, bar.c, baz.c]\n  user: which file contains the implementation of foo?\n  assistant: src/foo.c\n  </example>\n\n  <example>\n  user: write tests for new feature\n  assistant: [uses grep and glob search tools to find where similar tests are defined, uses concurrent read file tool use blocks in one tool call to read relevant files at the same time, uses edit file tool to write new tests]\n  </example>\n\n  # Proactiveness\n  You are allowed to be proactive, but only when the user asks you to do something. You should strive to strike a balance between:\n  1. Doing the right thing when asked, including taking actions and follow-up actions\n  2. Not surprising the user with actions you take without asking\n  For example, if the user asks you how to approach something, you should do your best to answer their question first, and not immediately jump into taking actions.\n  3. Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested by the user. After working on a file, just stop, rather than providing an explanation of what you did.\n\n\n  # Following conventions\n  When making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.\n  - NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).\n  - When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.\n  - When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the changes in a way that is most idiomatic.\n  - Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.\n\n  # Code style\n  - Do not add comments to the code you write, unless the user asks you to, or the code is complex and requires additional context.\n\n  # Doing tasks\n  The user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n  - Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n  - Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially.\n  - Implement the solution using all tools available to you\n  - Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.\n  - VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest writing it to CODE_LAW.md so that you will know to run it next time.\n  NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n  - Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\n  # Tool usage policy\n  - You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.\n  - It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.\n  - It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches as a batch that are potentially useful.\n  - For making multiple edits to the same file, prefer using the MultiEdit tool over multiple Edit tool calls.\n\n  You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines of text (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail.\n\n\n    ## Available Tools\n\n    ### Overview\n    Listed below are the details of all available tools, including:\n    - **Tool Description**: What the tool does\n    - **Tool Usage**: How to use the tool\n    - **Parameter List**: Name, Type, Required, Default Value\n    - **Calling Example**: `ToolName[{...}]`\n\n    ### Tool Calling Rules\n\n    You must abide by the following rules when calling tools:\n\n    1. **Action Format**: Fixed format: `Action: ToolName[JSON parameters]`\n    2. **Valid JSON**: The JSON parameters must be a valid JSON object (or array)\n    3. **Parameter Names**: Must use the key names from the tool's parameter list; do not invent new fields\n    4. **Check First**: If unsure how to call a tool, check the Parameters and Examples first instead of guessing\n\n    Below is the list of available tools: Tool name: Bash\nTool description:\nExecute a shell command within the project sandbox. Supports command chaining (&&, ||, ;) and limited cd inside the project root.\nFollows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).\n\nUsage\n- Use Bash for build/test/run commands or system utilities that are not covered by other tools.\n- Do NOT use shell commands for listing/searching/reading files:\n  - Use LS for listing, Read for file contents, Grep for content search, Glob for filename search.\n- Avoid interactive commands (vim/nano/top/htop/ssh/git rebase -i, etc.) — they are blocked.\n- Prefer the `directory` parameter over `cd`. If you must use `cd`, it must stay within the project root.\n\nParameters (JSON object)\n- command (string, required)\n  The shell command to execute. Command chaining is allowed.\n- directory (string, optional, default \".\")\n  Working directory relative to project root.\n- timeout_ms (integer, optional, default 120000, max 600000)\n  Command timeout in milliseconds.\n\nSafety Notes (MVP)\n- Commands are sandboxed to the project root; paths outside are denied.\n- Blocked high-risk patterns include: sudo/su/doas, mkfs/fdisk/dd, rm -rf /, remote-script exec (curl|bash, wget|bash).\n- Network tools like curl/wget are blocked by default in MVP (can be enabled via BASH_ALLOW_NETWORK=true).\n\nResponse Structure\n- status: \"success\" | \"partial\" | \"error\"\n  - \"success\": exit_code == 0 (MVP does not truncate output)\n  - \"partial\": exit_code != 0, or timeout with partial output\n  - \"error\": invalid params, blocked command, path denied, or timeout with no output\n- data: {stdout, stderr, exit_code, signal, truncated, command, directory}\n- stats: {time_ms, stdout_bytes, stderr_bytes}\n- context: {cwd, params_input, directory_resolved}\n- error: {code, message} (only when status=\"error\")\n\nExamples\n1) Run tests in the project root\nBash[{\"command\": \"pytest tests\"}]\n\n2) Run a command in a subdirectory\nBash[{\"command\": \"npm test\", \"directory\": \"frontend\"}]\n\n3) Chain commands (allowed)\nBash[{\"command\": \"python -m pip --version && python -V\"}]\n\nEdit: Replace a single, unique text snippet in an existing file.\n\n## Purpose\nMake surgical edits to existing files by replacing one specific text segment. Unlike Write (which replaces entire file content), Edit allows precise modifications without rewriting the whole file.\n\n## Key Features\n1. **Unique Anchor Replacement**: old_string must appear exactly once in the file.\n2. **Format Agnostic**: Automatically handles CRLF/LF differences.\n3. **Conflict Prevention**: Framework auto-injects mtime/size from prior Read.\n4. **Diff Preview**: Returns a unified diff showing your changes.\n5. **Dry Run Mode**: Use `dry_run=true` to preview changes without writing.\n\n## Parameters\n- `path` (string, required): Relative path to the file. POSIX style (use `/`), no absolute paths.\n- `old_string` (string, required): Exact text to replace. **MUST be unique** in the file. Copy directly from Read output.\n- `new_string` (string, required): Replacement text. Can be empty to delete old_string.\n- `dry_run` (boolean, optional): If true, only compute diff without writing. Default: false.\n\nNote: `expected_mtime_ms` and `expected_size_bytes` are **automatically injected by the framework** after you Read the file. You do NOT need to pass them manually.\n\n## Important Rules\n1. **ALWAYS Read the file immediately before editing**. The framework needs fresh mtime/size.\n2. **Copy old_string exactly** from Read output - no line numbers, no escaped `\\n`, preserve all whitespace.\n3. **old_string must be unique**. If it matches multiple times, include 2-5 lines of surrounding context.\n4. **Handle CONFLICT errors** by re-reading the file and re-applying your changes.\n5. **Use Write for new files**. Edit only works on existing files.\n\n## Response Structure\n- status: \"success\" | \"partial\" | \"error\"\n  - \"success\": edit applied successfully\n  - \"partial\": dry_run or diff truncated\n  - \"error\": invalid params, path denied, or I/O error\n- data.applied: Whether the edit was actually applied (false if dry_run)\n- data.diff_preview: Unified diff showing changes\n- data.diff_truncated: Whether diff was truncated\n- data.replacements: Number of replacements made (always 1 for successful Edit)\n- text: Human-readable summary\n- stats: {time_ms, lines_added, lines_removed, bytes_written}\n- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}\n- error: {code, message} (only when status=\"error\")\n\n## Error Codes\n- `NOT_FOUND`: File does not exist (use Write for new files)\n- `INVALID_PARAM`: Missing parameters, old_string not found, or old_string matches multiple times\n- `ACCESS_DENIED`: Path outside project root (sandbox violation)\n- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: OS-level permission error\n- `EXECUTION_ERROR`: Other I/O or execution errors\n- `IS_DIRECTORY`: Target path is a directory\n- `BINARY_FILE`: File appears to be binary\n- `CONFLICT`: File was modified since you read it (re-read and retry)\n\n## Examples\n\n### Simple function rename\nStep 1: Read the file\n```\nRead[{\"path\": \"src/utils.py\"}]\n```\n\nStep 2: Edit with exact match from Read output\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"src/utils.py\",\n  \"old_string\": \"def old_function_name(x):\",\n  \"new_string\": \"def new_function_name(x):\"\n}\n```\n\n### Multi-line replacement (include context for uniqueness)\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"src/config.py\",\n  \"old_string\": \"# Database settings\\nDB_HOST = \\\"localhost\\\"\\nDB_PORT = 5432\",\n  \"new_string\": \"# Database settings\\nDB_HOST = \\\"production.db.example.com\\\"\\nDB_PORT = 5432\"\n}\n```\n\n### Delete a block of code\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"src/main.py\",\n  \"old_string\": \"# TODO: Remove this debug code\\nprint('debug info')\\n\",\n  \"new_string\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n### Preview changes before applying\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"src/api.py\",\n  \"old_string\": \"return {'status': 'ok'}\",\n  \"new_string\": \"return {'status': 'success', 'code': 200}\",\n  \"dry_run\": true\n}\n```\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n1. **Don't add line numbers** - Copy text exactly as shown in Read output, without the \"N | \" prefix.\n2. **Don't escape newlines** - Use actual newlines in old_string/new_string, not `\\n`.\n3. **Don't guess the content** - Always Read first to see the exact current state.\n4. **Don't use Edit for new files** - Use Write instead.\n5. **Don't ignore CONFLICT errors** - They mean the file changed; re-read and retry.\n\nTool name: Glob\nTool description:\nFinds files by name using glob patterns (e.g. **/*.ts).\nMatches paths relative to the search root (path) and returns file paths only.\nCommon noisy directories (e.g. .git, node_modules, dist, build) are skipped by default.\nFollows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).\n\nUsage\n- Use Glob to find files by name or pattern (not file contents).\n- pattern is glob, not regex:\n  - *.md -> current directory only\n  - **/*.md -> recursive\n  - src/**/*.test.ts -> recursive under src/\n- path is the search root, relative to project root:\n  - \".\" -> whole project\n  - \"src\" -> only ./src\n- include_hidden controls dotfiles/dirs; include_ignored controls ignored dirs (use sparingly).\n\nParameters (JSON object)\n- pattern (string, required)\n  Glob pattern relative to the search root (path).\n- path (string, optional, default \".\")\n  Directory to start the search from, relative to project root.\n- limit (integer, optional, default 50, range 1-200)\n  Max number of matches to return.\n- include_hidden (boolean, optional, default false)\n  Include dotfiles/dot-directories.\n- include_ignored (boolean, optional, default false)\n  Traverse ignored directories (node_modules, dist, build, etc.).\n\nResponse Structure\n- status: \"success\" | \"partial\" | \"error\"\n  - \"success\": search completed, all matches returned\n  - \"partial\": results truncated (hit limit) or search aborted early (time/count limit)\n  - \"error\": no results AND aborted (timeout or count limit exceeded without matches)\n- data.paths: string[]\n  List of matching file paths (relative to project root).\n- data.truncated: boolean\n  true if results were truncated by limit.\n- data.aborted_reason: \"time_limit\" | \"count_limit\" | null\n  Set if search was stopped early due to fuse limits.\n- text: Human-readable summary with match list.\n- stats: {time_ms, matched, visited}\n- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved, pattern_normalized}\n- error: {code, message} (only when status=\"error\")\n\nError Codes\n- NOT_FOUND: search root does not exist.\n- ACCESS_DENIED: path outside project root (sandbox violation).\n- INVALID_PARAM: invalid pattern/path/limit.\n- TIMEOUT: search time limit exceeded with no matches.\n- INTERNAL_ERROR: unexpected failure.\n\nExamples\n1) List all Markdown files in the project\n\nGlob[{\"pattern\": \"**/*.md\", \"path\": \".\"}]\n\n2) Only list top-level TypeScript files under src/\n\nGlob[{\"pattern\": \"*.ts\", \"path\": \"src\"}]\n\n3) Include hidden files\n\nGlob[{\"pattern\": \"**/*.json\", \"path\": \".\", \"include_hidden\": true}]\n\nTool name: Grep\nTool description:\nSearches file contents using regular expressions.

All edits are matched against the ORIGINAL file content, applied together, and written once. Use this instead of calling Edit multiple times on the same file.\n\n## Key Features\n1. **Atomic Operation**: All edits succeed together or none are applied.\n2. **Original Content Matching**: All old_string anchors are matched against the original file, not intermediate states.\n3. **Conflict Detection**: Overlapping edit regions are detected and rejected.\n4. **Format Agnostic**: Automatically handles CRLF/LF differences.\n5. **Conflict Prevention**: Framework auto-injects mtime/size from prior Read.\n6. **Diff Preview**: Returns a unified diff showing all changes.\n7. **Dry Run Mode**: Use `dry_run=true` to preview changes without writing.\n\n## Parameters\n- `path` (string, required): Relative path to the file. POSIX style (use `/`), no absolute paths.\n- `edits` (array, required): List of edits to apply. Each edit has:\n  - `old_string` (string, required): Exact text to replace. **MUST be unique** in the original file.\n  - `new_string` (string, required): Replacement text. Can be empty to delete old_string.\n- `dry_run` (boolean, optional): If true, only compute diff without writing. Default: false.\n\nNote: `expected_mtime_ms` and `expected_size_bytes` are **automatically injected by the framework** after you Read the file.\n\n## Important Rules\n1. **ALWAYS Read the file immediately before editing**. The framework needs fresh mtime/size.\n2. **ALL old_string values must match the ORIGINAL file content** - not intermediate states after previous edits.\n3. **Each old_string must be unique** in the file. If it matches multiple times, include surrounding context.\n4. **Edits MUST NOT overlap**. If two edits target the same region, split them or use separate Edit calls.\n5. **Use Write for new files**. MultiEdit only works on existing files.\n6. **Handle CONFLICT errors** by re-reading the file and re-applying your changes.\n\n## Response Structure\n- status: \"success\" | \"partial\" | \"error\"\n  - \"success\": all edits applied successfully\n  - \"partial\": dry_run or diff truncated\n  - \"error\": invalid params, path denied, or I/O error\n- data.applied: Whether the edits were actually applied (false if dry_run)\n- data.diff_preview: Unified diff showing all changes\n- data.diff_truncated: Whether diff was truncated\n- data.replacements: Number of replacements made (equals number of edits on success)\n- data.failed_index: Index of failed edit (null on success)\n- text: Human-readable summary\n- stats: {time_ms, lines_added, lines_removed, bytes_written}\n- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}\n- error: {code, message} (only when status=\"error\")\n\n## Error Codes\n- `NOT_FOUND`: File does not exist (MultiEdit cannot create files)\n- `INVALID_PARAM`: Missing parameters, old_string not found, old_string matches multiple times, or edits overlap\n- `ACCESS_DENIED`: Path outside project root (sandbox violation)\n- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: OS-level permission error\n- `EXECUTION_ERROR`: Other I/O or execution errors\n- `IS_DIRECTORY`: Target path is a directory\n- `BINARY_FILE`: File appears to be binary\n- `CONFLICT`: File was modified since you read it (re-read and retry)\n\n## Examples\n\n### Multiple independent edits\nStep 1: Read the file\n```\nRead[{\"path\": \"src/config.py\"}]\n```\n\nStep 2: Apply multiple edits atomically\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"src/config.py\",\n  \"edits\": [\n    {\n      \"old_string\": \"DEBUG = True\",\n      \"new_string\": \"DEBUG = False\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"old_string\": \"LOG_LEVEL = \\\"INFO\\\"\",\n      \"new_string\": \"LOG_LEVEL = \\\"WARNING\\\"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"old_string\": \"MAX_RETRIES = 3\",\n      \"new_string\": \"MAX_RETRIES = 5\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Refactoring multiple functions\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"src/utils.py\",\n  \"edits\": [\n    {\n      \"old_string\": \"def get_user(id):\",\n      \"new_string\": \"def get_user(user_id: int) -> Optional[User]:\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"old_string\": \"def get_order(id):\",\n      \"new_string\": \"def get_order(order_id: int) -> Optional[Order]:\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Preview changes before applying\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"src/api.py\",\n  \"edits\": [\n    {\n      \"old_string\": \"return 200\",\n      \"new_string\": \"return HTTPStatus.OK\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"old_string\": \"return 404\",\n      \"new_string\": \"return HTTPStatus.NOT_FOUND\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"dry_run\": true\n}\n```\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n1. **Don't assume intermediate states** - All old_string values match the ORIGINAL file, not after previous edits in the list.\n2. **Don't create overlapping edits** - If edit A's region overlaps with edit B's region, the tool will fail.\n3. **Don't add line numbers** - Copy text exactly as shown in Read output.\n4. **Don't escape newlines** - Use actual newlines in old_string/new_string.\n5. **Don't guess the content** - Always Read first to see the exact current state.\n6. **Don't use for sequentially dependent edits** - If edit B depends on edit A's result, use separate Edit calls.\n\nTool name: Read\nTool description:\nReads a file from the local filesystem with line numbers. Optimized for code editing.\nFollows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).\n\nUsage\n- Use Read to view file content with line numbers for editing context.\n- Each line is prefixed with line number in format: \"   1 | content\"\n- Supports pagination via start_line and limit parameters.\n- Do NOT use bash cat/less/head/tail; use this tool for consistent output.\n\nParameters (JSON object)\n- path (string, required)\n  Path to the file (relative to project root).\n- start_line (integer, optional, default 1)\n  The line number to start reading from (1-based).\n- limit (integer, optional, default 500, max 2000)\n  The maximum number of lines to read.\n\nResponse Structure\n- status: \"success\" | \"partial\" | \"error\"\n  - \"success\": file read completely (reached EOF)\n  - \"partial\": truncated (more lines available) or encoding fallback used\n  - \"error\": file not found, access denied, binary file, or invalid parameters\n- data.content: string\n  File content with line numbers (format: \"%4d | %s\\n\" per line).\n- data.truncated: boolean\n  true if results were truncated (use start_line to paginate).\n- data.fallback_encoding: string (optional)\n  Present when encoding fallback was used (e.g., \"replace\").\n- text: Human-readable summary with pagination hints.\n- stats: {time_ms, lines_read, chars_read, total_lines, file_size_bytes, encoding}\n- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}\n- error: {code, message} (only when status=\"error\")\n\nExamples\n1) Read a file from the beginning\n\nRead[{\"path\": \"src/main.py\"}]\n\n2) Read with pagination (lines 101-200)\n\nRead[{\"path\": \"src/main.py\", \"start_line\": 101, \"limit\": 100}]\n\n3) Read a specific range\n\nRead[{\"path\": \"config.yaml\", \"start_line\": 50, \"limit\": 20}]\n\nError Handling\n- NOT_FOUND: File does not exist.\n- ACCESS_DENIED: Path is outside project root.\n- IS_DIRECTORY: Path is a directory (use LS instead).\n- BINARY_FILE: File appears to be binary.\n- INVALID_PARAM: start_line exceeds file length, or limit out of range.\n  (Note: empty file only allows start_line=1.)\n\nTool name: TodoWrite\nTool description:\nManages a task list for multi-step tasks. Overwrites the todo list with the current complete list.\nUse this tool to track progress, maintain goal consistency, and reduce context drift.\nFollows the Universal Tool Response Protocol (顶层字段仅: status/data/text/error/stats/context).\n\nWhen to Use\n- Use ONLY for multi-step tasks (>=3 steps) or when user explicitly requests progress tracking.\n- Do NOT use for simple questions or single-step tasks.\n\nUsage Guidelines\n- **Declarative Overwrite**: Always submit the FULL current list. Do not use incremental patches.\n- **Single in_progress**: At most ONE todo can be 'in_progress' at any time (0 is allowed).\n- **Update Timing**: Mark 'in_progress' BEFORE starting a sub-task, mark 'completed' immediately after finishing.\n- **Immediate Updates**: After completing any sub-task, call TodoWrite immediately to update its status. Do not wait until all tasks are finished.\n- **Cancellation**: Mark 'cancelled' for tasks no longer needed (instead of deleting).\n- **Concise Content**: Keep todo descriptions short and actionable (max 60 chars).\n- **Summary Required**: Always provide a concise overall summary in `summary`.\n\nParameters (JSON object)\n- summary (string, required)\n  Overall task summary describing the goal.\n- todos (array, required, max 10 items)\n  The full todo list (overwrites existing). Each item is an object with:\n    - content (string, required, max 60 chars): Task description.\n    - status (string, required): One of \"pending\", \"in_progress\", \"completed\", \"cancelled\".\n    - id (string, optional): Task identifier. **Do not provide**; the tool assigns ids and ignores any provided id.\n\nConstraints\n- Max 10 todo items per list.\n- Max 60 characters per todo content.\n- At most 1 'in_progress' item at any time.\n\nStatus Values\n- pending: Not yet started.\n- in_progress: Currently being worked on (max 1 allowed).\n- completed: Successfully finished.\n- cancelled: No longer needed.\n\nResponse Structure\n- status: \"success\" | \"error\"\n- data.todos: Updated todo list with tool-assigned ids (for model).\n- data.recap: Short summary for context tail (improves model attention).\n- data.summary: Echoed task summary.\n- text: Human-readable UI block (for user display).\n- stats: {time_ms, total, pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled}\n- context: {cwd, params_input}\n- error: {code, message} (only when status=\"error\")\n\nPersistence\n- When ALL todos are completed or cancelled, the tool automatically persists a markdown log (no model action needed).\n\nExamples\n1) Initialize todo list for a feature\n\nTodoWrite[{\"summary\": \"Implement user authentication\", \"todos\": [\n  {\"content\": \"Design auth flow\", \"status\": \"in_progress\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Create login endpoint\", \"status\": \"pending\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Add JWT validation\", \"status\": \"pending\"}\n]}]\n\n2) Mark current task done, start next\n\nTodoWrite[{\"summary\": \"Implement user authentication\", \"todos\": [\n  {\"content\": \"Design auth flow\", \"status\": \"completed\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Create login endpoint\", \"status\": \"in_progress\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Add JWT validation\", \"status\": \"pending\"}\n]}]\n\n3) Complete all tasks (triggers persistence)\n\nTodoWrite[{\"summary\": \"Implement user authentication\", \"todos\": [\n  {\"content\": \"Design auth flow\", \"status\": \"completed\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Create login endpoint\", \"status\": \"completed\"},\n  {\"content\": \"Add JWT validation\", \"status\": \"cancelled\"}\n]}]\n\nWrite: Create or overwrite a file with FULL content.\n\n## Purpose\nCreate new files or completely replace existing file content. This tool performs **full overwrite** - you must provide the complete file content, not patches or snippets.\n\n## Key Features\n1. **Auto-Mkdir**: Parent directories are created automatically if they don't exist.\n2. **Full Content Only**: Always provide the COMPLETE file content.\n3. **Diff Preview**: Returns a unified diff showing your changes.\n4. **Dry Run Mode**: Use `dry_run=true` to preview changes without writing.\n5. **Atomic Write**: Uses temp file + rename for crash safety.\n6. **Automatic Conflict Prevention**: Framework auto-injects mtime/size from prior Read (if available).\n\n## Parameters\n- `path` (string, required): Relative path to the file. POSIX style (use `/`), no absolute paths.\n- `content` (string, required): The FULL content to write to the file.\n- `dry_run` (boolean, optional): If true, only compute diff without writing. Default: false.\n\nNote: `expected_mtime_ms` and `expected_size_bytes` are **automatically injected by the framework** if you have previously Read the file. You do NOT need to pass them manually.\n\n## Conflict Prevention (Automatic)\nThe framework automatically handles conflict prevention:\n1. When you **Read** a file, the framework caches its `file_mtime_ms` and `file_size_bytes`\n2. When you **Write** to an existing file, the framework auto-injects these values\n3. If the file was modified by someone else, Write returns a `CONFLICT` error\n4. On `CONFLICT`: Re-read the file, re-apply your changes, and try again\n\n**Important**: You must Read a file before Writing to it (for existing files). The framework will report INVALID_PARAM if you try to Write an existing file without a prior Read.\n\n## Best Practices\n1. **Read Before Write**: Always use Read tool first before modifying existing files.\n2. **Check Diff**: Review the returned `diff_preview` to verify your changes are correct.\n3. **Handle Truncation**: If `diff_truncated=true`, use Read to verify the full content.\n4. **Use Dry Run**: For risky changes, use `dry_run=true` first to preview.\n5. **Handle CONFLICT**: If you get a CONFLICT error, re-read and re-apply changes.\n\n## Response Structure\n- status: \"success\" | \"partial\" | \"error\"\n  - \"success\": write succeeded with full diff preview\n  - \"partial\": dry_run or diff truncated\n  - \"error\": invalid params, path denied, or I/O error\n- data.applied: Whether the file was actually written (false if dry_run)\n- data.operation: \"create\" or \"update\"\n- data.diff_preview: Unified diff showing changes\n- data.diff_truncated: Whether diff was truncated (large changes)\n- text: Human-readable summary\n- stats: {time_ms, bytes_written, original_size, new_size, lines_added, lines_removed}\n- context: {cwd, params_input, path_resolved}\n- error: {code, message} (only when status=\"error\")\n\n## Error Codes\n- `INVALID_PARAM`: Missing path/content, absolute path used, or writing existing file without prior Read\n- `ACCESS_DENIED`: Path outside project root (sandbox violation)\n- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: OS-level permission error (EACCES)\n- `EXECUTION_ERROR`: Other I/O or execution errors (e.g., disk full)\n- `IS_DIRECTORY`: Target path is a directory\n- `CONFLICT`: File was modified since you read it (re-read and retry)\n\n## Examples\n\n### Create a new file (no prior Read needed)\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"src/utils/helper.py\",\n  \"content\": \"def greet(name):\\n    return f'Hello, {name}!'\\n\"\n}\n```\n\n### Update existing file (must Read first)\nStep 1: Read the file\n```\nRead[{\"path\": \"README.md\"}]\n```\n\nStep 2: Write with your changes (mtime/size auto-injected)\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"README.md\",\n  \"content\": \"# Updated Title\\n\\nNew content here.\\n\"\n}\n```\n\n### Update with dry run preview\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"config.json\",\n  \"content\": \"{\\\"key\\\": \\\"new_value\\\"}\\n\",\n  \"dry_run\": true\n}\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n- This tool does NOT support partial edits or patches. Always provide full content.\n- For editing specific sections of a file, first Read the file, modify the content in your response, then Write the complete modified content.\n- Empty content (`\"\"`) is allowed - this creates an empty file.\n- For NEW files, no prior Read is needed.\n- For EXISTING files, you must Read first (framework auto-injects lock parameters)."}, {"role": "system", "content": "# Project Rules (CODE_LAW)\n# Repository Guidelines\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n\nThis project follows a layered architecture for AI agents built on ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) principles:\n\n```\nMyCodeAgent/\n├── core/              # Foundational layer\n│   ├── agent.py       # Agent base class\n│   ├── llm.py         # LLM interface wrapper\n│   ├── message.py     # Message system\n│   ├── config.py      # Configuration management\n│   └── trace_logger.py # Logging utilities\n├── agents/            # Agent implementations\n│   └── codeAgent.py   # Main code analysis agent\n├── tools/             # Tool system\n│   ├── base.py        # Tool base class\n│   ├── registry.py    # Tool registration\n│   └── builtin/       # Built-in tools (LS, Glob, Grep, Read, Write, Edit, etc.)\n├── prompts/           # Prompt templates\n├── scripts/           # Entry points and utilities\n├── tests/             # Test suite\n└── docs/              # Design documentation\n```\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\n\n### Installation\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### Running the Agent\n```bash\n# Interactive chat with raw output\npython scripts/chat_test_agent.py --show-raw\n\n# Specify provider and model\npython scripts/chat_test_agent.py --provider zhipu --model GLM-4.7\n```\n\n### Testing\n```bash\n# Run all tests\npython -m pytest tests/ -v\n\n# Run specific tool tests\npython -m pytest tests/test_write_tool.py -v\npython -m pytest tests/test_protocol_compliance.py -v\n```\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n\n- **Language**: Python 3 with 4-space indentation\n- **Naming**: `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes\n- **Imports**: Use repo-absolute imports (e.g., `from core.llm import HelloAgentsLLM`)\n- **Documentation**: Include docstrings for all public classes and methods\n- **Type Hints**: Use type annotations where applicable\n\n## Tool Development Guidelines\n\nAll tools must follow the Universal Tool Response Protocol defined in `docs/通用工具响应协议.md`:\n\n1.

`tests/quick_test/doudizhu`\n\n### Completed Milestones (The \"Done\" Pile)\n* [✓] Identified the bug in the `hint()` function within `game.js`.\n* [✓] Refactored the `hint()` function to utilize existing game logic (`findValidPlay`) to calculate valid moves.\n* [✓] Implemented visual selection of valid cards and added user feedback (alerts) when no moves are available.\n\n### Key Insights & Decisions (Persistent Memory)\n* **Decisions**: Leveraged the pre-existing `findValidPlay` function rather than rewriting card rules from scratch.\n* **Learnings**: The original implementation was a placeholder that only selected the last card in the hand.\n* **User Preferences**: User specifically identified the \"Hint\" button feature as non-functional.\n\n### File System State (Snapshot)\n*(Files modified/created in this archived segment)*\n* `tests/quick_test/doudizhu/game.js`: Replaced the placeholder `hint()` function with logic that checks `gameState` (last played
